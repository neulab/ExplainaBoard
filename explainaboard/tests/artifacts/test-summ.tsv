washington ( cnn ) president barack obama says he is `` absolutely committed to making sure '' israel maintains a military advantage over iran . his comments to the new york times , published on sunday , come amid criticism from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu of the deal that the united states and five other world powers struck with iran . tehran agreed to halt the country 's nuclear ambitions , and in exchange , western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the iran 's economy . obama said he understands and respects netanyahu 's stance that israel is particularly vulnerable and does n't `` have the luxury of testing these propositions '' in the deal . `` but what i would say to them is that not only am i absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge , and that they can deter any potential future attacks , but what i 'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood , including iran , a clarity that if israel were to be attacked by any state , that we would stand by them , '' obama said . that , he said , should be `` sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table , '' he said . the framework negotiators announced last week would see iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060 , limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections . the talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until june 30 . but netanyahu and republican critics in congress have complained that iran wo n't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country 's leadership is n't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as obama says they are . obama said even if iran ca n't be trusted , there 's still a case to be made for the deal . `` in fact , you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us , all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they 're doing and that , for a long period of time , we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon , '' obama said .	in an interview with the new york times , president obama says he understands israel feels particularly vulnerable .  obama calls the nuclear deal with iran a `` once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ''  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and many u.s. republicans warn that iran can not be trusted .	washington ( cnn ) president barack obama says he is " absolutely committed to making sure " israel maintains a military advantage over iran . tehran agreed to halt the country 's nuclear ambitions , and in exchange , western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the iran 's economy . obama said even if iran ca n't be trusted , there 's still a case to be made for the deal .
( cnn ) the american pharmacists association is discouraging its members from participating in executions . on monday , the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy , stating that `` such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers . '' this bolsters the association 's previous positions to oppose the use of the term `` drug '' for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases . the group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection , said michelle spinnler , spokeswoman for the american pharmacists association . that spotlight includes a january supreme court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in oklahoma . this was prompted by clayton lockett 's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack . in georgia last month , the execution of female death row inmate kelly renee gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy . thirty-two sates allow capital punishment , and lethal injection is still the most common method . last month , utah gov . gary r. herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available . of the eight inmates currently on death row in utah , three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad . pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection . in texas , the department of criminal justice told cnn in march they are running out of their supply . in july 2011 , lundbeck inc. , the manufacturer of pentobarbital , decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment . the companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose , so states then turned to compounded preparations , spinnler said . `` pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way . '' she says . the new declaration by the american pharmacists association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the american medical association , the american nurses association and the american board of anesthesiology .	the american pharmacists association passed a new policy banning members from participating in lethal injections .  pharmacists say role as health care providers conflicts with participation in lethal injection .  the pharmacy association first adopted a policy against lethal injection in 1985 .

( cnn ) german police overnight thwarted a terrorist plot by a radicalized couple , a plan they suspect involved bombing a bicycle race near frankfurt , a german terrorism researcher briefed by investigators told cnn on thursday . german prosecutors and police said that a man and a woman had been arrested in the frankfurt-area town of oberursel on suspicion of planning a boston-style attack , but the authorities did not explicitly reveal the target . the suspected target , according to florian flade , the terrorism researcher , was a race planned for friday . the race loops around eshborn and frankfurt on may day each year , attracting large crowds of spectators along the cycle route . prosecutor albrecht schreiber said police recovered a pipe bomb ready to be used , 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition , a gun , the essential parts of a g-3 assault rifle and 3 liters of hydrogen peroxide , which becomes explosive at high concentrations and has been used in multiple terror plots in the west , including the 2005 london bombings . earlier thursday , andreas hemmes , a spokesman for the police of west hesse , told cnn that the house and car of two individuals in oberursel , in the forested hills west of frankfurt , had been searched . as a result of what had been found , police had expanded their search along the l3004 road on the bike race route , hemmes said . `` we suspect that there was a salafist background , '' said peter beuth , the interior minister for hesse , referring to ultra-fundamentalist interpretations of islam . `` police investigations at this stage indicate that we have thwarted an islamist attack . '' flade , a journalist at die welt and terrorism researcher who first broke the story of the police raids , told cnn that a german couple of turkish descent -- halil and senay d. -- were under arrest . he said the couple had ties to radical islamist circles in the frankfurt area . neither is suspected of having direct links to the leadership of a terrorist group . last week german police observed halil d. moving in and out of a small forest near where he was living . they suspect he was looking for a good place to hide a bomb along the bike race route , according to flade . flade said that according to german police documents , german police first became aware of the couple at the end of march when they went to a garden center near frankfurt to purchase hydrogen peroxide . he said the store employee contacted police after becoming suspicious for several reasons . the first was that the woman was covered in a full veil . the second was that the couple claimed they wanted to buy hydrogen peroxide to clean their fish pond in their garden , but the amount they were ordering would have been enough to clean dozens of such ponds . furthermore , after police thwarted a bomb plot by german extremists trained in the tribal areas of pakistan to kill american servicemen in germany in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide-based bombs -- the so-called `` sauerland '' plot -- german law had required such stores to report to police significant purchases of hydrogen peroxide . according to flade , after the tipoff , german investigators began trying to figure out who the couple were . all they had to go on was the surveillance footage . the woman was fully veiled and her male companion was blurry in the tape , so they did not immediately know who they were . but in early to mid-april they were able to identify them and start surveillance to investigate the couple 's radical ties . according to flade , german police established that the couple had recently traveled to spain , where they met with members of sharia4spain , a radical pro-jihadist group linked to al muhajiroun in the united kingdom . spanish police had monitored the meeting in spain . they also established that the couple had links to radicals who had gone to fight with aqim , al qaeda 's north african affiliate . and they found the couple were in contact with a young radical islamist from frankfurt who had gone to fight in syria at the end of last year and was recently killed . the pipe bomb that was recovered by police appears to have similarities to devices built by boston marathon bombers tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev . flade said the device recovered near frankfurt included nails as shrapnel . the boston bombers downloaded instructions from a recipe in inspire magazine , an online engish language magazine put out by al qaeda in yemen , which has also been translated into german and other languages . in august 2013 , the british security agency mi5 revealed to parliament 's intelligence and security committee that inspire has been `` read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the uk since its first issue ( in 2010 ) . we judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots . '' like other european countries , germany is grappling with an unprecedented terrorist threat because of the high number of its citizens who have traveled to syria and iraq . in recent years there has been growing concern over radicalization in germany 's large turkish diaspora community . travel to syria is particularly easy for individuals of turkish descent because turkey is the entry point for most foreign fighters traveling to syria . according to flade , almost 700 germans are believed to have traveled to syria and iraq , with up to 90 % joining isis . one-third of these have returned to germany and 70 to 80 have been killed in the fighting in syria and iraq . there has only been one fatal terrorist attack in germany since 9/11 -- the shooting death of two u.s. airmen outside frankfurt airport by a lone-wolf radicalized islamist in march 2011 . cnn 's fred pleitgen contributed to this report .	german police say they think they `` have thwarted an islamist attack , '' interior minister for hesse state says .  german terrorism researcher : couple accused of planning bomb attack on bicycle race near frankfurt .

( cnn ) in a tragic echo of the catastrophic events in haiti in 2010 , a powerful earthquake struck one of the poorest nations on earth today . the latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7.9 , which would actually makes it about 40 % larger than the 7.8 currently being reported . that 's less than half the size of the previous major event nearby in 1934 , which killed around 10,000 people . unfortunately , it is quite possible the number of dead in kathmandu could rise to match it . we knew this disaster was coming eventually . geophysicists have long monitored how fast the earth 's plates are moving , and we know that the entire subcontinent of india is being driven slowly but surely underneath nepal and tibet at a speed of around 1.8 inches per year . it 's the reason everest exists . latest updates on nepal earthquake . over millions of years , the squeezing has crushed the himalayas like a concertina , raising mountains to heights of several miles and triggering earthquakes on a regular basis from pakistan to burma . saturday 's quake was neither unusual nor unexpected , although it was larger than most . in the 81 years since the 1934 bihar earthquake , the land mass of india has been pushed about 12 feet into nepal . think of all that movement getting stored in a giant spring lying under nepal . the spring is stuck on a broad , rough surface which we call a fault plane ( a fault line is what we see when it emerges from the ground ) . fallen : nepal 's historic landmarks . sometimes , energy stored in the spring gets big enough to slip catastrophically , releasing all that pent-up strain and generating shaking strong enough to destroy buildings and kill people over a huge area . the bigger the area that slips , and the larger the pent-up energy , the greater the damage . saturday 's slip took place over an area about 1,000 to 2,000 square miles over a zone spanning the cities of kathmandu and pokhara in one direction , and almost the entire himalaya mountain width in the other . a part of india slid about one to 10 feet northwards and underneath nepal in a matter of seconds . we have this kind of detailed data thanks to major advances in seismology over recent years . using measurements of shaking recorded on seismometers scattered across the world and sent in near or real time to agencies like the u.s. geological survey and to universities such as columbia , we can infer the location and magnitude of a big earthquake very quickly . avalanches hamper everest rescue efforts . not just that : we can now estimate the pattern and speed of rapid sliding across its fault surface . what used to take months of careful academic study now takes minutes of computation . in haiti in 2010 , although the earthquake was more than 20 times weaker than saturday 's , well over 100,000 people are thought to have been killed around port-au-prince by the shaking and its after-effects . yet despite some differences , the nepal and haiti earthquakes also share similarities -- both geological events were known to be approaching , and both struck areas afflicted by widespread poverty , rapid increases in population in urban areas , uncoordinated changes in building infrastructure and lack of adherence to improved building codes . about 1.45 million people live in kathmandu , the majority in poorly constructed homes not designed to withstand the kind of shaking seen on saturday . nepal has a per capita income of around $ 1,350 , only a notch above that of haiti , and among the lowest in the world . meeting building codes in new construction , or taking on expensive retrofitting , is way beyond the means of most . to make matters worse , the valley itself appears to focus the destructive shaking of earthquake waves . studies have long predicted that the kathmandu area was due a magnitude-8 earthquake , or higher -- one study predicted between 21,000 and 42,000 fatalities if a magnitude-8.1 earthquake had struck the area . ( fortunately , saturday 's shaking was half that intensity ) . still , this catastrophe comes at a delicate time for nepal as it emerges from a long-running civil war and its economy has been improving steadily . we have to hope that recovery from both can somehow take place despite the enormous challenges ahead .	a magnitude-7 .8 earthquake struck nepal on saturday .  colin stark : we knew this disaster would come .	the latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7.9 , which would actually makes it about 40 % larger than the 7.8 currently being reported . that 's less than half the size of the previous major event nearby in 1934 , which killed around 10,000 people . in the 81 years since the 1934 bihar earthquake , the land mass of india has been pushed about 12 feet into nepal .

'' clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to barack obama . o'malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month . the former governor , who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the polk county democrats in des moines , said that although clinton is an `` eminently qualified candidate , '' the democratic party is full of `` good leaders .

'' o'malley , like other democrats , appears to refrain from directly attacking clinton . although last month on abc , he said that the presidency is `` not some crown to be passed between two families , '' he has not focused on her . he has , however , openly teased a presidential run . `` i know that , as democrats , we expect -- and i have heard this all over the country -- the democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face , '' he said . `` they believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary . '' he concluded : `` it would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party 's nomination for president .

( cnn ) it 's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week 's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in panama : a historic handshake between president barack obama and cuban president raul castro . but this first meeting of obama and castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story . or at least obama is hoping it wo n't be . after all , the president has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits , where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments . the reality is that the united states has been losing ground in this increasingly important region , and obama needs to put on a strong performance in panama at the summit of the americas if the u.s. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends , but who have drifted away as america has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the middle east . unfortunately , america has lost influence in latin america to a hyperactive china , a cunning russia and a troubling iran , all of which have made inroads in the region at washington 's expense . this gathering therefore offers a chance for the u.s. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with latin american and caribbean blood who make their homes in the united states . the foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there . but they need attention , and the panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building . but first : do no harm . large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events , and the u.s. , with its vast experience in preparing for high-level multilateral meetings , knows the importance of dotting the i 's and crossing the t 's . but this has n't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and pr disasters for the u.s. just look at the last summit , held in cartagena , colombia , which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after secret service agents embarrassed the united states by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms , in violation of basic security protocols . they were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee . as a result of all this , the americans looked dumb , incompetent -- and cheap . and back in 2009 , the president -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast-talking , fiery anti-american president of venezuela . the late hugo chavez outplayed the leader of the free world , who had just taken office and was trying to show america 's new `` outstretched hand '' toward the foe of the george w. bush era . the summit hit a depressing low for the obama administration when chavez walked up to obama and , as the cameras clicked , handed the american president a copy of the book `` open veins of latin america , '' which blames the region 's woes on the u.s. and europe . yet the problems in cartagena were n't just symbolic . regional leaders lined up against washington , which had refused to include cuba in the summit , and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless havana was also invited . america was cornered . all this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early clinton years , when the president issued an invitation to `` democratically elected '' heads of state of latin america , which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship . back then , the u.s. had just led the creation of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region , namely democracy , free trade and economic growth . that 's what it should aim for every time : articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it . can obama manage something similar this time ? true , the president has come armed with his new cuba policy . unfortunately , in an effort to placate critics who say obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists , the white house has miscalculated with venezuela , handing the repressive regime of chavez 's successor , nicolas maduro , a stick with which to beat the u.s. obama has long and rightly ignored maduro 's claims that the u.s. planned to overthrow him . but a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed maduro -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the u.s. , something he will no doubt play that up in panama . all this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with latin americans who already have complicated feelings toward the u.s. over its cold war support for unseemly right-wing dictators , a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing soviet-backed communism from taking hold . but those days are behind us . today , the people want prosperity , they want democracy , and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the united states . too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms : opposition leaders are in prison in venezuela ; a prosecutor who criticized the president was found dead in argentina ; press freedom is under siege in several countries ; and corruption is reaching new highs . all of this suggests that if obama plays his cards right , he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of latin america that their goals are also america 's goals ; that like them , he supports democracy , human rights , the rule of law , full freedom of expression and free elections in every country . the fact that he met with cuban dissidents was welcome , and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with cuba . for the millions in latin america that still live in poverty , these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury . but if obama can show them that the united states is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives , then he will leave a longer-lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake .	president barack obama is attending the summit of the americas .  frida ghitis says he must work to improve ties with region .	the reality is that the united states has been losing ground in this increasingly important region , and obama needs to put on a strong performance in panama at the summit of the americas if the u.s . is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends , but who have drifted away as america has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the middle east . but they need attention , and the panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building .
( cnn ) let 's start with a pop quiz ( space junkies can skip this test ) . true or false , mercury is : 1 ) the planet closest to the sun in our solar system . 2 ) so hot that water could n't possibly exist there . 3 ) something used in old-style glass thermometers . 4 ) a planet you do n't think about very often . answers : true , false , true ( but not what we 're talking about in this story ) and i 'm guessing no . 4 is true too . if you flunked the test , it might be because mercury ( the planet ) suffers from bad ( or very little ) press . or , maybe it 's just bad lighting . mercury orbits about 35,983,125 miles from the sun . compare that to earth -- we 're about 93 million miles from the sun . mercury 's closeness to the sun makes it hard to see except at dawn and twilight . this may be one reason we do n't think about it much . venus , on the other hand , the planet between earth and mercury , appears to be the brightest planet in the sky . it 's so bright it 's been mistaken for an airplane . pilot sends plane into dive after mistaking venus for oncoming plane . but back to mercury . it 's getting some attention from the media now because it 's about to get a visitor . the nasa spacecraft messenger ( an acronym for mercury surface , space environment , geochemistry , and ranging ) is about to crash onto mercury . the probe was launched in 2004 and traveled more than six and a half years before it started orbiting mercury on march 18 , 2011 . now , messenger is running out of fuel and nasa says it will hit the planet 's surface at 8,750 mph ( 3.91 kilometers per second ) around april 30 . you wo n't be able to see it hit because messenger will crash on the side of mercury facing away from earth . there 's no way to save the spacecraft , but mission operators at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory ( apl ) in laurel , maryland , have been doing what they can to delay the inevitable . they 've been using the little bit of fuel left on board to maneuver the spacecraft to keep it in orbit . they 'll do one final maneuver on friday , april 24 . `` following this last maneuver , we will finally declare the spacecraft out of propellant , as this maneuver will deplete nearly all of our remaining helium gas , '' mission systems engineer daniel o'shaughnessy said at a recent media briefing . `` at that point , the spacecraft will no longer be capable of fighting the downward push of the sun 's gravity . '' but rather than mourn the loss , scientists held a briefing to celebrate the mission 's success . `` for the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system , '' said john grunsfeld , associate administrator for the science mission directorate at nasa headquarters in washington . one of messenger 's big findings : it sent back data indicating that ice in mercury 's shadowed polar regions , if spread over an area the size of washington , would be more than two miles thick , nasa said . it also took some amazing photos of the planet . so the messenger mission is ending , but scientists say they 'll be busy for years studying data from the probe . and if you want to see mercury with your own eyes , you may be in luck if you can find an area with dark skies . it will be visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of may . your favorite astronomy website will have some helpful guides . here are a few we found : • earthsky.org . • astronomy . • sky and telescope . • stardate .	spacecraft to crash on mercury this month .  messenger probe has been in orbit since 2011 .

( cnn ) '' a long , long , time ago ... '' those five words , when uttered or sung , makes baby boomers immediately think of don mclean 's pop masterpiece `` american pie . '' it 's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory , which millions of americans know by heart , is 44 years old . all sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song , brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus , which starts as `` bye , bye , miss american pie . '' there is no real way to categorize mclean 's `` american pie '' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer-hall chant and high-art rock . on tuesday , christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer . mclean was a paperboy when , on february 3 , 1959 , he saw that buddy holly , ritchie valens and j.p. `` the big bopper '' richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in clear lake , iowa . `` the next day i went to school in shock and guess what ? '' mclean recalled . `` nobody cared . rock ' n ' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and buddy had n't had a big hit on the charts since '57 . '' by cathartically writing `` american pie , '' mclean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever . having recorded his first album , `` tapestry , '' in 1969 , in berkeley , california , during the student riots , mclean , a native new yorker , became a kind of weather vane for what he called the `` generation lost in space . '' when his cultural anthem `` american pie '' was released in november 1971 , it replaced bob dylan 's `` the times they are a changin '' as the peoples almanac of the new decade . it 's important to think of `` american pie '' as one would of henry longfellow 's `` evangeline '' or johnny mercer 's `` moon river '' -- an essential americana poem emanating wistful recollection , blues valentine , and youthful protest rolled into one . there is magic brewing in the music and words of `` american pie , '' for mclean 's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream , like those jack kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel `` on the road . '' don mclean : buddy holly , rest in peace . influenced by pete seeger and the weavers , mclean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s , when `` american pie '' topped the billboard charts , and has never shed the cape . wandering far and wide , singing `` american pie '' at windblown dance halls in wyoming and cloistered colleges in new england , at huge amphitheaters in california and little coffee houses in the hudson river valley , mclean has performed his global anthem thousands of times . yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure . when mclean prods audiences by rhapsodizing `` and they were singing '' everybody spontaneously joins in with the `` bye , bye '' chorus . watching mclean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective happening . what makes `` american pie '' so unusual is that it is n't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman , which , like a sacred river , keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere . when `` american pie '' suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it 's almost impossible not to sing along . like `` danny boy '' or `` streets of laredo '' or `` shenandoah , '' it 's eternal . with illusions to football fields and rock ' n ' roll , river levees and nursery rhymes , the song cascades along like a boat going down niagara falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes . after all these years , `` american pie '' still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss . the song is alive and joyful , yet fretful about a world gone wrong . it is a song that will never die . a reverie for the ages . there is a jump to the chorus , which forces the mind to relive the '50s , '60s and '70s , to troll through the back pages of our lives while , like a traditional irish folksong , it reminds us of fate . while mclean , the muse , has rightfully not tried to interpret `` american pie , '' it 's fair to surmise that `` the king '' is elvis presley , `` helter skelter '' refers to the charles manson murders , the `` jester on the sidelines in a cast '' is bob dylan , and `` jack flash '' the rolling stones . but who knows ? the lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations . as a literary artifact of the early 1970s , there is n't anything to compare to `` american pie . '' normally , i do n't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents , for that matter . but the fact that the recording industry of america and the national endowment of the arts chose `` american pie '' as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition 's importance as an enduring piece of pop art . the other four were `` over the rainbow '' ( by harold arlen and e.y `` yip '' harburg ) , `` white christmas `` ( by irving berlin ) , `` this land is your land '' ( by woody guthrie ) and `` respect '' ( by otis redding ) . that is fine company . quite simply , `` american pie '' is one of the greatest songs ever written . and tuesday the original lyrics found a new home .	manuscript of `` american pie '' lyrics is sold to unnamed buyer for $ 1.2 million .  douglas brinkley : the song , a talisman for its age , brings joy to people 44 years later .	there is no real way to categorize mclean 's " american pie " for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer - hall chant and high - art rock . on tuesday , christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer .
( cnn ) last month 's so-so jobs numbers confirm the challenges our economy still faces . despite recent gains , only 126,000 jobs were added , the lowest since december 2013 . wages remain sluggish . and unemployment may still be at 5.5 % , but there is wide concern among labor experts and economists that too much job growth is in part-time low-income work . low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis , and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy . nearly 60 % of the people in america 's workforce are paid hourly and work part-time . most part-time employees are doing low-wage work . tackling this growing trend is complex . but there is a simple step we can take to improve the conditions of low-wage workers today . congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules . here is how this issue works : america 's major fast-food chains , retailers and department stores use `` just-in-time '' scheduling to maximize profit , which in turn creates unstable and stressful work environments for low-wage workers . this type of scheduling has increased dramatically because of sophisticated software that ties staffing to expected customer traffic . algorithms , built on sales and economic data , provide real-time information for managers to make personnel adjustments . not surprisingly , such haphazard scheduling wreaks havoc with low-wage workers . hourly low-income workers endure significantly greater fluctuations in their hours and less predictability in how much they earn than full-time employees . many do n't even know their weekly schedules until the last moment . a university of chicago study found that 41 % of early career hourly workers and 47 % who work part-time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules . imagine dealing with this as you are trying to earn a basic living , find reliable child care , get new vocational skills , or attend to medical needs . women and workers of color most acutely struggle with this practice . women comprise over two-thirds of the nearly 20 million workers in low-wage jobs like home health care , fast food work , and cash services . similarly , a large proportion of minorities work low-wage jobs . nearly 50 % of african-americans and latinos receive their hours with a week or less notice . by comparison , almost 40 % of whites receive weekly notice . minorities also have much less of an ability to control their hours . only 10 % of latinos and 12 % of black workers reported being able to set their hours within certain limits or freely . within this same context , 18 % of whites said they could . child care is the primary casualty of just-in-time scheduling . because of erratic shifts , child care centers often ca n't accommodate a working mother 's schedule . many must attend to informal arrangements , which by nature are unstable and unreliable . traditional economic safeguards have offered little help to these workers . unions , for example , have provided little protection against just-in-time scheduling because of their nascent role in the service economy . real solutions exist . states and cities are enacting laws to address scheduling abuses . new york , minnesota and michigan previously introduced promising legislation . and in december , san francisco became the first jurisdiction to pass a `` retail worker bill of rights . '' this ordinance limits how chain stores can alter their employees ' schedules . still , there is no substitute for federal action . too many people work in states with little protection . washington ignores the problem because congressional republicans have shown little interest in the plight of low-wage workers . last summer , the schedules that work act was introduced in congress . according to the national women 's law center , the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules , receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes , and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss . although the bill expired last session it will likely be reintroduced . and yet the bill will most likely not pass . congressional republicans have demonstrated they are more interested in unraveling worker protections under the guise of supporting economic growth . conservatives should embrace this work-schedule legislation . the bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations , not just work . protecting shift workers is likewise good for business . studies show that workers who exercise greater control over their hours are happier and more efficient . conversely , just-in-time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction . while washington stalls , it 's everyday americans who are hurt . it 's the single mom in chattanooga working as a walmart cashier who 's juggling work and childcare for her kids . it 's the arby 's line cook in fort worth who needs reliable shifts to make her dialysis treatments . it 's the stock man at an amazon fulfillment center in lehigh valley who ca n't get his son to pre-algebra tutoring because of his erratic shifts . our leaders have the unique responsibility to protect america and attend to the critical economic challenges of our time . even with the weaker-than-expected jobs report we know our overall economy is improving , yet income-inequality is deepening . congress must endorse a recovery that 's inclusive , livable , and one that enables every family to balance competing obligations . they can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices .	vijay das : so-so jobs numbers contain truth that worries labor experts : too much american job growth is in part-time low-income work .  he says erratic work schedules tied to customer traffic wreaks havoc with low-wage workers ' lives . congress can fix this .	nearly 60 % of the people in america 's workforce are paid hourly and work part - time . most part - time employees are doing low - wage work . congress should help low - wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules .
marietta , georgia ( cnn ) the little-known star of this week 's no . 1 car chase movie , `` furious 7 '' is n't a car . it 's an airplane . film producers hired a lockheed c-130 hercules to fly five cars 12,000 feet high , open a cargo door at the rear of the plane and parachute them out in a spectacular free-fall stunt . geronimo ! happy 60th birthday to the hercules -- the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history . lockheed has been making these airplanes longer than the legendary b-52 bomber and the famous u2 spy jet . unlike those planes , the c-130 has never become a household name . the fact that `` furious 7 '' producers chose a plane that was designed in the 1950s tells you a little something about the success of the hercules . the film makes it appear as if another plane -- a c-17 globemaster iii -- drops the cars . but in real life , it took a hercules to pull it off . shooting the scene posed unique logistical challenges , said stunt coordinator jack gill in a featurette video about the mission . `` you start throwing all those cars out together -- you 've got to figure out spacing . and these things drop very fast , '' gill said . jeremiah beaudin of international air response co-piloted the stunt . `` we have to be very precise in our headings and our altitudes , '' he says in the video . the hercules is big . it 's tough . it 's versatile . it refuels helicopters in flight . it can fly a small military force and its heavy equipment around the world -- and land on short , unfinished airstrips . at lockheed 's marietta , georgia , factory in 1955 , the governor of georgia christened the first production c-130a by smashing a bottle of chattahoochee river water across its nose . the plane then proceeded to take off from nearby dobbins air force base . on tuesday , exactly 60 years later , georgia gov . nathan deal recreated the ceremony -- christening a brand new super hercules during a birthday party of sorts for lockheed executives and military dignitaries . `` i 'm told that the 2,500th version of this aircraft is now on the ( assembly ) line inside this building , '' deal said . `` it transports , it becomes a war airplane as necessary and it is recognized as the true workhorse . '' inside the plane 's cockpit , lockheed test pilot steve knoblock said he 's done a lot of air-drop testing while flying c-130s . `` we 've dropped some crazy things out , '' knoblock said . `` air dropping a car out of an airplane is easy . whatever we can fit inside the ( cargo ) hold , we can drop . '' several factors come into play for a pilot making a drop , knoblock said , including payload weight , wind speed and timing . `` we have to give time for the car to clear the airplane , let the parachutes deploy , and then actually open , '' he said . one tricky decision involves how high the plane drops its cargo . `` there 's a trade off -- between dropping it low and being more accurate ... and dropping it high where you have a little more safety in how it will land . '' knoblock also explained how the c-130 's robust landing gear helps the plane survive difficult landing conditions . `` the pilot gets to decide how hard the touchdown 's going to be , '' he said . `` sometimes to get his performance , he needs to really let it crunch on the ground . but the airplane can handle it . '' meanwhile , in the back of the plane , lockheed loadmaster lucky madsen showed off the plane 's new reversible deck , which makes it easier to switch the floor from a flat surface ... to a floor with rollers embedded in it . the rollers make it easier to move cargo around and launch it out the back of the airplane . the legacy surrounding the hercules has been built by 60 years of successful missions , including : in 1989 , a flight crew aboard a hercules named teal 57 was credited with saving the crew of a national oceanic and atmospheric administration hurricane hunter airplane . while flying through hurricane hugo , the noaa plane lost an engine and suffered damage to a second engine . teal 57 happened to be nearby and located a safe place for the noaa plane to escape the eye of the deadly category 5 storm . everyone returned safely to base . in 2012 , israeli brig . gen. joshua shani revealed how he flew a hercules on a successful hostage rescue mission to entebbe , uganda . four c-130s helped rescue passengers from a hijacked air france flight in 1976 . `` at some places that were particularly dangerous , we flew at an altitude of 35 feet , '' to evade radar . `` trust me , this is scary ! '' he told idfblog.com . during the military build up to 2003 's u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a hercules test dropped the biggest conventional weapon in the pentagon 's arsenal -- a so-called moab -- known in military circles as `` the mother of all bombs . '' a c-130 ejected the 21,000-pound bomb out its rear cargo door high above florida 's eglin air force base . the bomb fell to earth and detonated in a spectacular fire ball . in the past , the air force attached small solid-fuel rocket engines to some c-130s . the added power allowed steep takeoffs on super short runways . the hercules was n't designed to land on aircraft carriers . they 're too short . nonetheless , a hercules did it -- during a test in 1963 . that 's how amazing this plane is . but nothing lasts forever , and the c-130 is no different . the air force has been developing a so-called `` super short takeoff and landing aircraft '' that might replace the hercules after 2020 . the air force research laboratory calls it speed agile . the proposed four-engine aircraft would be able to transport super heavy loads across oceans and to arrive and depart on short , improvised airfields . pentagon planners apparently are hoping to create a hercules-inspired success story that will extend into the latter half of the 21st century .	the type of plane used for a jaw-dropping stunt in `` furious 7 '' is 60 years old .  lockheed 's c-130 hercules is the longest continuously produced military plane in history .  c-130 factory in georgia celebrates the flight of the first c-130 production model .	film producers hired a lockheed c-130 hercules to fly five cars 12,000 feet high , open a cargo door at the rear of the plane and parachute them out in a spectacular free - fall stunt . happy 60th birthday to the hercules -- the oldest continuously produced family of military planes in history . but in real life , it took a hercules to pull it off .
( cnn ) i was a copygirl in my fourth month at the chicago daily news , my second assigned to the city desk . it had become my custom at 4 o'clock , when the city desk secretary left for the day , to move over to her spot to help answer the phones as the beat reporters called in to check out for the day . it was so quiet that afternoon -- 70 years ago , on thursday , april 12 , 1945 -- the city editor and assistant city editor had felt comfortable leaving their desks . the second city editor , guy housley , was to my left . to my right , perhaps 6 feet away , the telegraph editor , george dodge . at 4:50 , the old-fashioned upright `` candlestick '' telephone on his desk rang -- the direct line the associated press used to alert editors to major news events . he answered , replaced the bell-like receiver on its hook and said to everyone in general and no one in particular , `` roosevelt is dead . '' the silence of shock . until dodge jumped up so quickly , his swivel chair crashed into the glass-fronted bookcase behind him -- a symphonic orchestra cymbals sound -- and ran to what was called the tube room , with its row of associated press teletype machines . housley said , `` clear the decks for action . '' the words had barely cleared his lips when city editor clem lane half-ran back into the city room . hal o'flaherty , director of the daily news foreign service , was only a step or two behind . the door of the managing editor 's office that opened into the city room flew open , and managing editor everett norlander joined them around the copy desk , where dodge was editing the bulletin . lane wheeled toward the rewrite desk . `` cleveland ! get downstairs . get the reaction . '' the main entrance to the chicago daily news building also served as the main entrance to the northwestern railroad terminal , with its commuter trains to the north shore communities . a veritable sea of lemmings would be coming up that marble incline for the next hour . not that charlie cleveland could linger . the daily news , an afternoon newspaper , was strictly limited in the hours it could publish . only an hour or so remained for extras . i knew clips would be needed and ran to the library , the old `` morgue . '' they 'd heard and had a splay of white envelopes on president franklin d. roosevelt -- big and bulging -- spread out . they had one , as i recall -- a small one -- on harry s. truman . i grabbed it and ran back down the corridor . bob lewin , who usually handled labor stories , had been told `` to do something on the new president . '' he opened the truman envelope , spread out the newspaper clippings and reached for one of the `` books '' in a wire basket within easy reach of reporters and rewritemen : five sheets of copy paper stapled together , with four sheets of carbon paper between . to be rolled into typewriters and have the necessary copies : the top one for the editor , a carbon copy for the reporter 's reference and three others for distribution to various editors or news desks . lewin 's eyes moved over the clippings , evaluating , rejecting , selecting , deciding what to use . at last , he started typing . because of the time pressure , the story would be done in `` short takes '' : two , maybe three paragraphs at a time . he wrote : `` the new president -- the 33d in the history of the united states -- is harry s. truman . `` he was automatically elevated to the presidency on the death of president roosevelt . `` truman will be 61 on may 8 . '' lewin ripped the book out of the typewriter roller . i left him the bottom page for reference and rushed the top page to lane . back by lewin , i read over his shoulder : `` born in lamar , mo. , truman 's political rise was spectacular . `` he was relatively little known outside of his home state when he was elected to the u.s. senate in 1934 . he had the backing of the late tom `` boss '' prendergast , of the kansas city machine . this time , lewin gave me a nod . i pulled out the book , the typewriter roller ratcheting protest . after two more takes , lane said , `` okay , that 's it . '' cleveland was back . the cricket-like click click click of typewriter keys at the rewrite desk drew me , and i stood by to take his story to lane : `` word of president roosevelt 's death struck chicago late this afternoon with numbing suddenness . `` within a few minutes after the bulletins came to the daily news , the office switchboards were swamped with calls for verification . `` so great were the number of calls , that the lines became clogged and many queries could not be handled . `` many of the callers spoke as if disbelieving the report -- as if it were some wildly spread rumor . `` the same kind of uncertainty was noticed in the faces of the crowds thronging homeward . word passed from one to another : `` ' did you hear that ? roosevelt is dead ? is it true ' ? '' cleveland 's story delivered , i returned to the city desk to help with the calls . many , as he had mentioned , from people wanting to know whether it was true but some from reporters and beat men who 'd been heading home , reporting the reaction where they were . a copyboy rushed around the room , dropping off copies of the first extra -- the simple news in a 76-point-type headline : roosevelt dead . statements began coming in from local officials and civic leaders , a few phoned in but most from the city news bureau , which served the chicago newspapers with local news as the wire services did with national news . i sorted through the multiple copies , separating them into ever-growing stacks . the second extra was dropped off . roosevelt dead with the subhead : dies at 63 of hemorrhage in georgia . the last extra had a three-column photo of roosevelt , edged in black , a two-column of truman and a story on the president 's death and funeral plans . as the editors talked , i heard one ask , `` what kind of president do you think he 'll make ? '' and o'flaherty , director of the daily news foreign service , said , `` if there 's anything to the american system , the man will rise to the office . '' i 've thought of that through the years as truman has risen in the opinion of presidential historians . the atom bomb . the marshall plan . the berlin airlift . the truman doctrine . recognition of the state of israel . desegregation of the armed services . ordering u.s. forces to oppose the invading forces when north korea crossed the 38th parallel and invaded south korea , then organizing a united nations army . firing douglas macarthur . i continued to sort the statements from officials . lane asked me to take one set down to lloyd lewis . the chief editorial writer had a corner office at the far end of the long office corridor . i found him sitting in the dark , looking out the window at the chicago skyline . sensing my presence , he said , `` i wonder what the world will be like without him . '' `` i do n't know , sir . '' in the dusk , the quiet , i suspect he did n't expect an answer , but i thought about franklin delano roosevelt , who served in the white house for an unprecedented 12 years . `` he 's the only president i can remember .

garissa , kenya ( cnn ) the sign painted onto the school entrance wall reads : `` youth is a mistake , adulthood is a struggle , old age is a regret . '' the black humor of the message provides some light relief for a school that lives in constant fear of a terrorist attack because of what is taught inside its walls . the students ( aged 8 to 14 ) at the ibnu-siina school in northern kenya are getting a so-called `` western '' education , taking lessons in subjects like mathematics , science and english . but it 's an education that al-shabaab -- the somali-based terror group -- is trying to prevent the children from obtaining , according to the head of the school . `` these men , al-shabaab , want to make sure everything goes negative , '' headmaster james ndonye told cnn . `` they want to make sure they terrify the teachers so they go to their homes -- so the kids in this area do n't get what they deserve .

'' and it 's not just in kenya . terrorist groups across the sahel region are waging war on schools , teachers and students . in northeast nigeria , the islamist militant group boko haram has been waging war against the government -- and the civilian population -- for several years . most notoriously , perhaps , was boko haram 's kidnapping of around 270 girls from a boarding school in chibok , borno state , last april . but the group has also carried out numerous other attacks on schools , slaughtering young boys and girls as they sleep in their dormitories . last year in garissa , james ndonye lost five of his 11 teachers amid rising fears of an al-shabaab attack on the school . he replaced them , but it was n't easy . yet despite the ever-present threat of terror , ndonye has stayed to help the children . `` i risk my life because -- for this class , there 's a target we have for last year ... and i love that class very much , '' ndonye said . exclusive : tracking the killer behind garissa massacre .	looming threat of al-shabaab has terrified students and teachers in kenya .  terror group massacred 147 at kenyan university last week .	the students ( aged 8 to 14 ) at the ibnu - siina school in northern kenya are getting a so - called " western " education , taking lessons in subjects like mathematics , science and english . but it 's an education that al - shabaab -- the somali - based terror group -- is trying to prevent the children from obtaining , according to the head of the school . terrorist groups across the sahel region are waging war on schools , teachers and students .

( cnn ) on the surface , the mix-up seems incomprehensible : how can a volunteer sheriff 's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a taser , killing a man ? that 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris . bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead . `` oh ! i shot him . i 'm sorry , '' bates said in a video of the shooting . but it 's happened before . in a well-publicized 2009 case , a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22-year-old oscar grant in oakland , california . the former officer , johannes mehserle , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead . mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct . so how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser ? here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . so if an officer is left-handed , the gun should be on the left side . bates ' attorney said his client is left-handed . but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side . `` i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , '' bates said in a written statement to investigators . after bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he `` used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , '' said clark brewster , bates ' attorney . `` he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the taser , '' brewster said . `` both the gun and the taser have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake . '' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . '' an attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture '' theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland ( of oscar grant ) , '' the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . there 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! taser ! taser ! '' as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .	attorney : robert bates assumed the gun was a taser because he saw a laser sight on it .  harris family lawyers say there are stark differences between the gun and taser used .  in 2009 , an officer in california also said he mistakenly used his gun instead of a taser .	that 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year - old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris . bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead . law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side .
( cnn ) robert bates says he gets it , how you might wonder how a cop could confuse a pistol for a stun gun . bates -- the tulsa county , oklahoma , reserve sheriff 's deputy accused of manslaughter in the death of a fleeing suspect -- told nbc 's `` today '' show friday that he used to think that , too . `` believe me , '' he told the show in his first appearance since being charged in the april 2 death of eric harris , `` it can happen to anyone . '' harris died after bates shot him -- accidentally , he says -- after calling out `` taser ! taser ! '' in a tussle captured on a police body camera . bates told investigators that he mistook his firearm for the stun gun . how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser ? while bates is at the center of the maelstrom over harris ' death , he is n't the only one under scrutiny . the oklahoma naacp wants charges against other officers involved in harris ' death , and a state and federal investigation into the tulsa county sheriff 's office 's treatment of minorities . the sheriff 's office also finds itself fending off allegations that supervisors were told to forge bates ' training records . in his interview friday with `` today , '' bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies . `` that is absolutely the truth . i have it in writing , '' he told the show . and on thursday , a sheriff 's office official denied to the tulsa world newspaper that any records had ever been forged . as an advanced reserve deputy , sheriff 's office policy calls for bates to have completed 480 hours of the field training officer program , according to the tulsa world . bates would also have needed firearms certification training . officials have yet to locate records showing what training bates completed , said maj. shannon clark of the sheriff 's office . but clark did say it 's possible that some training requirements may have been waived . sheriff stanley glanz has the authority to waive any department policies , clark said . `` the policies within our organization are signed off by the sheriff , but there are also policies that give the sheriff the ability to waive any policy within our organization . that 's part of being a sheriff 's office , '' clark told the newspaper . glanz told kfaq radio this week that officials ca n't find records of bates ' firearms certification . the instructor who provided that training is now a u.s. secret service agent , and officials have n't been able to locate training records she was supposed to have turned in , glanz told the station . other discrepancies have surfaced about training that bates claims to have attended , including questions about active shooter and homicide investigation instruction . tulsa world reporter dylan goforth said the paper had been told by multiple sources that bates ' records had been falsified . the newspaper has not said who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why . but the orders apparently started years ago , `` back when ( bates ) was trying to get on as a deputy , '' reporter ziva branstetter told cnn 's `` new day . '' bates has donated equipment to the department and was also a donor to glanz 's re-election campaign , leading to allegations he had essentially paid to be a cop . he rejected that claim in the `` today '' interview as `` unbelievably unfair . '' bates ' attorney , clark brewster , also has rejected the allegations of poor training or forgery as unfounded . he said those making the accusations include fired sheriff 's office employees represented by the law firm that also represents harris ' family . `` his training is extensive and certainly adequate , '' brewster told cnn on thursday . bates appeared on the `` today '' show with his wife , two daughters and brewster . he seemed composed but said he was still might be in shock over what had happened . `` i can tell you it stayed with me for a number of days , '' bates said . `` i 'm not at all sure it 's not still with me today . lack of sleep , inability to concentrate , all of those plus more . you know , i still ca n't believe it happened . '' in describing the events leading up to harris ' death , bates said he was parked several blocks away from the site where an undercover deputy was conducting a sting operation to catch harris in the act of illegally selling a gun . bates said he had participated in `` several hundred '' such operations but always in a backup role where he would come in and `` clean up '' after deputies , taking photos and notes . but as deputies rolled up to arrest him after the sale , harris bolted from the vehicle and ran toward bates ' position . as deputies were trying to subdue harris , bates told investigators he saw an opportunity to use his stun gun to help get the suspect under control . `` i yelled , ' taser ! taser ! ' as required in training . the deputy below me ducked , he pulled away from it so that i could , '' bates said . `` the laser light is the same on each weapon . i saw the light and i squeezed the trigger , '' bates told `` today . '' the result was not the staccato click of a well-deployed stun gun . instead , it was a gunshot . `` i shot him ! i 'm sorry ! '' bates is heard emotionally saying on video of the incident . bates apologized to harris ' family , who have rejected allegations he was violent and on drugs . harris ' brother , andre harris , said this week that he did n't think the shooting was racially motivated . instead , he said , `` this is simply evil . '' but bates , who is charged with second-degree manslaughter , said he did n't mean to kill harris . his attorney has called it an `` excusable homicide . '' `` i rate this as no . 1 on my list of things in my life that i regret , '' said bates , who is free on $ 25,000 bail .	`` i rate this as no. 1 on my list of things in my life that i regret , '' robert bates tells `` today ''  he says he did n't mean to kill eric harris and rejects claims his training records were forged .  `` i still ca n't believe it happened , '' bates tells the nbc show .

( cnn ) the terrorist group al-shabaab has claimed an attack on garissa university college in eastern kenya , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage . the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in east africa is deteriorating fast . somalia-based al-shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in kenya , the most well-known of them being the massacre at the westgate shopping centre in nairobi in 2013 . cross-border raids into kenya by the group , however , date back to 2011 . al-shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in nairobi , which sent troops to somalia as part of an african union mission in support of somalia 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from al-shabaab and other militants for several years . al-shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the koran as al-qaeda and isis ( also known as islamic state ) , but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support . its origins lie in al-ittihad al-islami ( unity of islam ) , one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of siad barre in 1991 . these disparate groups fought each other and a u.n. peacekeeping mission in the somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country , from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later . al-shabaab ( literally `` the youth '' ) split from unity of islam in 2003 and merged with another radical islamist group , the so-called islamic courts union . as their alliance obtained control of somalia 's capital mogadishu in 2006 , ethiopia , the only majority christian country in the region , took military action against the group . the offensive weakened al-shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern somalia , but it failed to defeat it . to the contrary , ethiopia 's invasion and occupation of parts of somalia -- although invited by the somali government and backed by the african union -- enabled al-shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign `` christian '' invasion . initially , the group primarily attacked ethiopian forces , but soon began to `` expand '' its activities against the somali government as well . the first attack outside somalia was an attack in the ugandan capital of kampala in 2010 . soon after this , cross-border raids in kenya began , predominantly targeting christians there . increasing its links with al-qaeda , al-shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to isis . much will depend on how the relationships between al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) , a long-time ally of al-shabaab based in yemen , and isis develop . the key point is that al-shabaab 's attack in garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors . it must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism . clearly , the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern , and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of islam . but the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems : from economic development challenges to environmental degradation ; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence ; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance . these entrenched inequalities help al-shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits , who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons . attacking a university in northern kenya and separating christian from muslim students epitomizes the way al-shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious , tribal and nationalist identities . ultimately , though , this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people , over territory , and over resources . as long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political , economic , and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests . it is important to counter al-shabaab directly , including by military means . but there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by al-shabaab . as garissa shows , these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit . copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .	terrorist group al-shabaab has attacked a kenyan college , killing and taking hostages .  it is a clear indicator the security situation in east africa is deteriorating , says stefan wolff .  more than military action aloe is needed to combat terrorism in the region , he says .

( cnn ) three orthodox rabbis accused of planning and participating in the torture of jewish men who refused to divorce their wives were convicted tuesday of conspiring to commit kidnapping . rabbis mendel epstein , 69 ; jay goldstein , 60 ; and binyamin stimler , 39 , were found guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in new jersey federal court . goldstein and stimler were also convicted on charges of attempted kidnapping . the rabbis were part of a ring accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars to orchestrate the kidnappings of jewish husbands to persuade them through torture involving electric cattle prods and screwdrivers to grant `` gets , '' a document that jewish law requires a husband to present to his wife in order to be issued a divorce , court papers said . the men were arrested in october 2013 following an fbi sting operation that ended with goldstein , stimler and six other men with ski masks , surgical blades and a 30-foot nylon rope in a warehouse in middlesex county , new jersey . lawyers for each of the rabbis told cnn they plan on appealing the convictions . `` rabbi epstein still firmly believes that he was protecting women 's rights and was protecting the agunahs and the families , '' said robert stahl , the lawyer for epstein . without a `` get , '' a woman is considered an `` agunah , '' a chained woman bound to a man no matter how over the marriage might actually be . an orthodox jewish woman who does not receive a get runs the risk of being shunned in her community and labeled an adulteress if she moves on . any future children she has are considered bastards permitted to marry only other bastards . `` i do n't think this was a traditional kidnapping , '' said aidan o'connor , the lawyer for goldstein . goldstein is a sofer , a jewish scribe who transcribes the torah and writes other religious documents , including divorce papers , his attorney said . nathan lewin , the attorney for stimler , called the verdict `` shocking '' and said his client was only present at the warehouse as a witness for the ceremonial signing of the document . `` there 's no evidence that rabbi stimler knew what was going to be going on , '' lewin said . `` of course we 're going to take all the steps to correct this injustice . '' epstein 's son , david epstein , was acquitted on tuesday of kidnapping charges . the jury returned not guilty verdicts on the attempted kidnapping charges against mendel epstein , and on more severe kidnapping charges against the three rabbis . nine other individuals previously pled guilty in the case to conspiracy charges , according to a press release from the u.s. attorney 's office in new jersey . henry mazurek , the lawyer for david epstein , said his client was grateful for the jury 's decision but called his client 's acquittals `` bittersweet '' next to his father 's conviction . `` he really believes that ( his father ) was a champion of someone who was voiceless in his religion , '' mazurek said . sentencing is set for july 15 . the men face up to life in prison .	three rabbis found guilty of conspiracy to commit kidnapping in new jersey federal court .  they were accused of orchestrating kidnapping , torture of jewish men who refused to allow their wives a religious divorce .  lawyers for the rabbis said they plan on appealing the verdicts .

( cnn ) editor 's note : ines dumig was recently announced as a center grant recipient . sahra , a somali refugee , left her home at 14 years old . throughout her journey in search of asylum , she managed to overcome dangers and discomforts . but she never gave up , and she continuously reminded herself to keep going . she 's the focus of ines dumig 's photo series `` apart together . '' dumig met sahra through a photo workshop at refugio , a shelter in munich , germany , for refugees and torture victims . what drew dumig to sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences . `` it really impressed me how she deals with everything , '' dumig said . `` she 's strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened , the culture where she comes from . '' the number of refugees seeking asylum in the european union increased by 25 % last year , with germany receiving the most applications . one of the reasons dumig decided to photograph sahra is because growing up in germany made dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle . another reason has to do with dumig 's interest in people 's emotions and finding one 's identity . `` i realized so many people want to come to europe , and i always had the feeling to disappear or to go away , '' dumig said . `` seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged i am . '' `` apart together '' serves not only as a documentation of sahra , but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds . the title of dumig 's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another , the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together . `` sometimes we feel strong , sometimes we feel lost -- that 's kind of universal , i think , '' dumig said . `` that 's why i want to universalize ( sahra 's ) story as well , not only make it about her . '' the underlying themes of `` apart together '' include the feelings of isolation and `` otherness '' and the search for a valuable human dignity . social media . follow @ cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` every one of these ( refugees ) have strong stories , and in the bureaucratic system , they are just a number or a document , '' dumig said . `` but they are a person , they are people with emotions and lives . '' sahra is currently under the status of `` suspension of deportation , '' meaning german immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation . dumig describes sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation . regardless of the challenges sahra faces as a refugee in germany , she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience , determined to establish a new life for herself . she has learned to speak german fluently , and she has started working in the nation as well . like an unsolved photographic puzzle , each photo within `` apart together '' provides a piece of insight into sahra 's experiences . there is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces , because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of sahra 's life . many of dumig 's photos are not of sahra herself , but instead show her surroundings . this makes `` apart together '' rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions . the photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature , as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one . `` i think everyone interprets by themselves , by however way they perceive it through their own experience . that 's up to the viewer , '' dumig said . `` it depends on who looks at the pictures . ... everyone will see something different . '' `` apart together '' allowed dumig to share various special moments with sahra , and they were both able to learn from each other . `` it was just something we both got something out of , '' dumig said . ines dumig is a photographer based in germany .	ines dumig 's photo series `` apart together '' follows a somali refugee living in germany .  the underlying themes include isolation and `` otherness '' and the search for human dignity .	sahra , a somali refugee , left her home at 14 years old . she 's the focus of ines dumig 's photo series " apart together .

( cnn ) when les moonves sits down at a restaurant in hollywood , it 's usually the waiter 's lucky night . as the president and ceo of cbs corp. , which includes showtime , moonves runs a powerful television network in a town where nearly every waiter also wants to be an actor . but when he walked into craig 's in west hollywood last year , those roles were reversed . this time , moonves ' waiter , gabriel salvador , was the one serving up a mouthwatering opportunity that had nothing to do with the shrimp diavolo . instead , he was offering moonves an `` in '' to the most coveted match-up in boxing : floyd mayweather vs. manny pacquiao . `` moonves ' love of boxing , our love of boxing -- that gave me the confidence to say to him ' give me a chance , ' '' said salvador , an actor who has appeared in `` bones '' and `` blue bloods . '' `` i said ' i can help you make this fight happen , ' and he looked at me like , ' okay , i 'm listening . ' '' that 's when salvador told moonves his son trained at the hollywood gym owned by freddie roach , pacquiao 's trainer , and that he would put in a good word for moonves . at that point , salvador told cnn , he was driven more by his passion to see the fight happen than any real connection to roach . but he got roach 's phone number from his son , elijah , who was skeptical of his father 's plan . everybody had already tried , his son said . but salvador made the call and gained an audience in roach . `` i said , ' listen , i can help you make this fight happen , ' '' salvador said in an interview with cnn . salvador helped set up a meeting between moonves , roach and himself at scarpetta in beverly hills that he says began with a discussion about the legacy of boxing . `` mr. moonves said to me , ' if this fight happens , you 're going to be sitting there , ' '' said salvador . salvador 's role ended after that dinner . what followed was a series of meetings between moonves and both sides that eventually ended the stalemate keeping pacquiao and mayweather from entering the same ring . the may 2 fight -- on the pay-per-view services of showtime and hbo -- is expected to gross as much as $ 600 million . with that kind of money , and a smattering of media buzz around salvador 's story , inevitable questions circulated over what , if any , reward he should get , given the epic nature of the fight . when asked to comment , pacquiao 's team downplayed salvador 's role . `` for him giving les my phone number i do n't think he deserves a finder 's fee , '' roach told cnn . promoter bob arum said salvador `` got his 10 minutes of fame , '' though he called salvador `` a really nice guy . '' salvador insists he is not seeking money , and a cbs spokesman confirmed his role in the initial meeting . `` my reward will be sitting at the fight , '' salvador said . moonves made good on that promise -- salvador will be ringside on saturday night . `` it 's about taking a chance , '' salvador said . `` it 's about putting people in touch with each other and being able to sit back and say , ' wow , i planted that seed . ' ''	gabriel salvador set up an initial meeting between a tv exec and manny pacquiao 's trainer .  salvador is an actor and waiter at craig 's restaurant in los angeles .	instead , he was offering moonves an " in " to the most coveted match - up in boxing : floyd mayweather vs. manny pacquiao . that 's when salvador told moonves his son trained at the hollywood gym owned by freddie roach , pacquiao 's trainer , and that he would put in a good word for moonves . the may 2 fight -- on the pay - per - view services of showtime and hbo -- is expected to gross as much as $ 600 million .
( cnn ) chinese police have arrested more than 133,000 people and seized 43.3 tons of illegal narcotics during a six-month anti-drug campaign , the country 's ministry of public security has announced . authorities also handled 115,000 drug-related crimes -- such as robbery -- and 606,000 cases of drug use during the nationwide campaign to `` ban drugs in hundreds of cities , '' liu yuejin , assistant minister of public security , said wednesday . the figures were nearly double the same period a year earlier , while the amount of narcotics seized was up by 44.9 % , according to the ministry . liu said drug trafficking groups have `` suffered a heavy blow '' and drug users have been `` forcefully regulated . '' however , the police also paid a price , liu said , in quotes carried by the state-run xinhua news agency . nine police officers died and another 657 were wounded in the mission , with 76 severely wounded . the ministry rewarded 60 units and 100 people . liu said china 's drug-related problems were still severe , with online drug trafficking an increasing problem . he said the ministry had launched a three-month online campaign starting in april targeting people engaged in drug-related internet crimes . over the past nine months , a string of movie and television stars , film directors and pop singers have been arrested and charged over drug related incidents , including jaycee chan , son of kung fu movie star jackie chan , who was convicted on a drug charge and sentenced to six months in prison by a beijing court . in august last year , dozens of management agencies representing actors and singers signed an agreement with beijing authorities banning drug use from the entertainment industry and pledging to sack any artists who broke the law .	police arrest 133,000 people and seize 43.3 tons of narcotics in a six-month period .  china launches a new online campaign to crack down on online drug crimes .  celebrities have been embroiled in the nation 's intensifying anti-drug campaign .

( cnn ) on may 28 , 2014 , some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in china 's northwestern xinjiang region . but they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event . instead , the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits . armed soldiers guarded the exits . in the patently unfair , open air trial that followed , 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed . three were sentenced to death . the public mass sentencing was part a china 's `` strike hard '' campaign against unrest in xinjiang , a campaign the government claims was launched to combat `` terrorism '' and `` separatism . '' but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . today , amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide . much of it makes for grim reading . in pakistan , the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific taliban attack on a school in peshawar in december . more than 60 people have been put to death since , and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows . iran and iraq executed people for `` terrorism , '' and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes . in a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before , governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism . other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates . jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in december , putting 11 murder convicts to death , with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime . in indonesia , authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety `` national emergency . '' six people have already been executed this year . a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool . the rise was largely because of developments in egypt and nigeria , where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict . the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both . there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence , as united nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed . it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough . at amnesty international , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades . thankfully , most of the world now appears to agree with us . the numbers speak for themselves . in 1945 when the united nations was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty . today , 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice . last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago . despite the troubling developments we recorded last year , there was still much good news to be found . the number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year , from 778 to 607 . this number does not include china , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine . executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-saharan africa -- equatorial guinea , somalia and sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter . the americas continued to be execution-free , apart from the united states . those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history . they must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment . fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment . with determination , i know that we can achieve this goal .	amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide ; much of it makes for grim reading .  salil shetty : countries that use executions to deal with problems are on the wrong side of history .	but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . today , amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide .
london ( cnn ) it was n't messrs clooney , pitt and their nine accomplices who sailed down an elevator shaft and cracked open dozens of safety deposit boxes at a london vault during the easter weekend . but last weekend 's raid in the heart of the city 's jewelry district feels like it has been taken from a movie like `` ocean 11 '' given its daring and planning . such robberies are rare : the gang did n't follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in london for more than 40 years . in september 1971 , the staff of a bank in baker street , central london , arrived at work to find that thieves had dug a 40-yard tunnel from a shop they had rented , hauled in a thermic lance and explosives and opened the strong room . the gang got away with a haul worth around £30 million ( the incident later formed the basis of the movie `` the bank job . '' ) but how are such heists organized ? roy ramm , a former commander of specialist operations at london 's scotland yard for 27 years , explains . in the uk burglaries and robberies are often committed by working-class people , people who would otherwise have blue collar jobs . in more than 25 years as a scotland yard detective , i never met a raffles- or a thomas crown-style criminal from a middle-class background who had then turned to the hard side of crime . sophisticated heists like the hatton garden raid are generally not a natural progression for burglars who began with smaller domestic break-ins . many neighborhood criminals commit burglaries to feed drugs habits and acquire long strings of convictions that mean they are always on the police radar . occasionally , they steal things they ca n't sell and end up dumping valuable paintings or antiques when they are not able to sell them on quickly . more specialist criminals -- those , for example , who target museums or country houses -- will be very specific and steal only what they know they can quickly convert to untraceable cash . many of those who commit the bigger crimes or run major criminal enterprises combine high iqs with a kind of raw street intelligence . one of their skills is the ability to recognize a criminal opportunity when it presents itself , possibly from a source of inside information . probably the biggest difference between any heist you 'll see in a movie and its real-life equivalent is the motive . i 've never encountered any criminal who committed a high value crime just for the challenge or to prove that it could be done . the only reason has been for the money , often to support a certain lifestyle and to fund other criminal enterprises . inside information is one way of identifying a criminal opportunity , using people who are able to provide that crucial detail or who will participate in some small way to facilitate the crime . the brinks mat robbery in 1983 -- a case which i was involved in at the time -- saw a criminal gang escape with gold bullion worth more than £28 million ( around £88 million -- or $ 130million -- adjusting for inflation ) from a warehouse at london 's heathrow airport . the knightsbridge safety deposit robbery of 1987 saw a gang make off with tens of millions of pounds in cash and valuables from an upscale london neighbourhood ( the true amount will never be known ) . both were made possible by inside information : it 's an angle that london detectives investigating last weekend 's heist will be looking at very closely . the planning behind the hatton garden raid will have been meticulous . the target will have been observed , perhaps for months , and the thieves will have decided on the right time to commit the crime . a long weekend or a public holiday are occasions when more time may be available , also perhaps when regular staff are away . sometimes the mastermind behind the raid will need a larger team of criminals to do a specific job . usually they will already be known directly to each other , perhaps because they worked on other jobs together . possibly a specialist can be brought in by another team member -- but they have to be able to trust each other and trust comes from understanding , so gangs in the uk tend to come from the same social and ethnic group , maybe even limited to one relatively small geographic area . even though there is more diversity in society , it would be unusual to find a broad ethnic or social mix in the team put together for a major crime . vehicles will have been obtained , stolen or purchased for cash and their identities cloned or changed . equipment will have been sourced . everything will have been cleaned , cleaned and cleaned again to remove forensic traces . they will plan routes that avoid cctv and timings that attract the least attention . they will have untraceable disposable phones and an outside team to warn the inside men of any problems . they will have planned their getaway , their clean-up and how and when they are going to dispose of anything that might link them to the crime scene -- and of course how they are going to sell on the proceeds of their crime . what criminals steal does n't vary that much . cash is probably first choice , followed by anything that can quickly and easily be converted to cash , like gold , jewellery and watches . the conversion of stolen goods to cash is risky and expensive : the brinks mat bullion that was traced was because it had been clumsily smelted and then sold on . fine paintings and rare antiques are less desirable for experienced criminals -- unless they are stealing to order -- because they are so identifiable and because the black market is so much smaller . a painting may sell at an international auction for millions of dollars but it will only fetch a fraction of its true value from a dishonest collector . london detectives investigating the hatton garden heist will be looking very closely at the possibility of inside involvement . but police enquiries wo n't stop there . they will look at every aspect of how the target business operates , then try to think like criminals to identify the weaknesses in physical and operational security that the gang may have been informed about or else spotted and then exploited . the forensic assault on the crime scene will be immense . in recent years forensic science has made major advances in identifying trace evidence and investigators will look for any scrap of evidence that might yield the dna of a criminal . cctv footage from street cameras and from inside private premises will be analyzed and vehicle movements logged and cross-checked . rewards for information will be offered . witnesses will interviewed . in the police 's criminal intelligence branch , the movements of known criminals will be analyzed and the networks of sources -- informers -- will be tasked to report what they hear . the details of any identifiable goods which have been stolen will be circulated to known markets , both in the uk and internationally . the detectives investigating these major crimes in the uk see them as an exciting challenge to their professionalism . they do n't admire the criminals but they have less contempt for a gang that builds a sophisticated plan and causes no personal harm to anyone than say for a violent robber . but the investigation will still be relentless .	police in london are trying to catch the gang which staged a multi-million heist during the easter vacation .  former police commander : such crimes require meticulous planning and use of information by criminals .  the masterminds behind such complicated crimes carefully assemble their gangs with men they can trust .	but last weekend 's raid in the heart of the city 's jewelry district feels like it has been taken from a movie like " ocean 11 " given its daring and planning . such robberies are rare : the gang did n't follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in london for more than 40 years . sophisticated heists like the hatton garden raid are generally not a natural progression for burglars who began with smaller domestic break - ins .
( cnn ) the bizarre circumstances surrounding freddie gray 's death have inflamed tensions across the country . how could a man suffer a severe spinal cord injury after getting arrested ? and what happened in the 30 minutes before he was taken to a hospital ? gray wavered in and out of a coma and died sunday , one week after his arrest . it 's not clear how he suffered the spinal cord injury . but gray is far from the only suspect who died under questionable circumstances after he was already in custody . here are several other cases : date of arrest : march 31 , 2015 . date of death : march 31 , 2015 . what happened : police in vineland , new jersey , responded to a call of a disorderly person , and white was arrested and handcuffed . police dispatch recordings include an officer saying white `` tried to grab my gun . '' one witness , agustin ayala , told the vineland daily journal that white was resisting arrest . but two others told wcau that police attacked white while he was already handcuffed . `` they punched him , stomped him , kicked him and then they let the dog out of the car , '' ricardo garcia told the station . `` the dog bit him on his face and around his body . there 's no call for that . once a man is handcuffed and unconscious , you should have stuck him in the patrol car and take him to the police station . '' witness luis martinez gave a similar account . `` the other cop let the dog out , and they just kept punching him and the dog kept biting him at the same time , '' martinez told wcau . `` he was on the floor , like he was knocked out . '' as white was taken to a hospital , he became unresponsive , nj.com reported . he was pronounced dead at the hospital . the aftermath : the cumberland county prosecutor 's office has been investigating white 's death , and officials have been waiting for the results of white 's autopsy to learn the exact cause of death , nj.com said . two vineland officers have been placed on administrative leave . and after vineland police received criticism on its facebook page about white 's case , the department started hiding unfavorable comments , the press of atlantic city reported . an activist filed an open public records act request , saying the department 's official facebook page was a matter of public record . vineland police later restored the critical comments on its page . date of arrest : march 2 , 2014 . date of death : march 2 , 2014 . what happened : sheriff 's deputies in new iberia , louisiana , claimed white shot and killed himself in the back of a squad car -- even though white had been frisked and handcuffed . `` short of him being houdini or david copperfield , it 's not possible , '' white family attorney carol powell-lexing said . the incident began when authorities were responding to a fight in a gas station parking lot . about six blocks from the store , an iberia parish deputy saw white and stopped him , state police said . according to the service report from the sheriff 's office , cpl . justin ortis received no description of the men involved in the fight . he was told only that they were black , `` and one of the males mentioned having a gun , '' the report said . white consented to a pat-down , and ortis found marijuana in his pocket . attorney benjamin crump said that detail makes the official narrative even more suspicious . `` if you pat someone down and you can feel a small package of marijuana , would n't you feel a gun ? '' he said . state police said once white arrived at the police station , he refused to get out of the patrol car . `` as the deputy requested assistance from other deputies , white produced a handgun and fired one round , striking himself in the back , '' state police said . white was pronounced dead at a local hospital . the aftermath : an autopsy concluded white 's death was a suicide -- but said he was shot in the chest , not in the back , like police had said . the autopsy report also said white was `` reportedly in a locked patrol car with his hands handcuffed behind him when officers heard a shot and found the decedent slumped over . '' state police have handed over their investigation to prosecutors , who said a decision wo n't be made until a federal civil rights investigation wraps up . date of police encounter : july 5 , 2011 . date of death : july 10 , 2011 . what happened : officers in fullerton , california , were responding to a call about a homeless man looking into car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars . video of the incident showed thomas , who was schizophrenic , slow to cooperate . fullerton police officer manuel ramos then tells him : `` you see my fists ? they 're getting ready to f -- - you up . '' thomas , who is unarmed and shirtless , stands and another officer walks over . they hit him with their batons and hold him on the ground as he begs for help . `` ok , i 'm sorry , dude . i 'm sorry ! '' he screams . at one point , thomas says he ca n't breathe . the officers tell him to lie on his stomach , put his hands behind his back and relax . toward the end of the beating , the video shows , thomas cries out for his father : `` dad ! help me . help me . help me , dad . '' by the end of the video , he is lying in a pool of blood . the aftermath : the orange county coroner ruled thomas ' death a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed , leaving him unable to breathe . thomas ' mother , cathy thomas , received a $ 1 million settlement from the city of fullerton . officer ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter , and cpl . jay patrick cicinelli was charged of involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force . both pleaded not guilty . in 2014 , a jury acquitted both ramos and cicinelli . date of arrest : september 6 , 2013 . date of death : september 7 , 2013 . what happened : azucena was arrested after running a red light and leading los angeles police on a chase . over the next half hour , azucena repeatedly said he had asthma and could n't breathe , the los angeles times reported . officers continued ignoring him . `` help me , help me , help me , '' he said , according to a report by the los angeles board of police commissioners . `` i ca n't breathe . i ca n't breathe . help me , please . '' `` you can breathe just fine , '' one sergeant told him , according to the times . `` you can talk , so you can breathe . '' he did n't breathe for much longer . azucena was so weak that officers had to carry him to a station 's holding cell for booking and left him face-down on the floor , the times reported . by the time paramedics arrived , azucena 's heart had stopped . the aftermath : a coroner concluded that asthma probably killed azucena and that his death was an accident . last month , the los angeles city council unanimously agreed to a $ 1.35 million settlement for azucena 's mother , the times said . the investigation into the officers ' actions is ongoing . date of arrest : november 19 , 2013 . date of death : november 19 , 2013 . what happened : an officer in durham , north carolina , was taking huerta to the police station for a second-degree trespassing violation . the durham police department said the teen died from a self-inflicted gunshot while handcuffed in the back of the squad car . durham police chief jose lopez said gunshot residue tests were conducted on huerta and the arresting officer , and the north carolina state bureau of investigation `` found that huerta was wearing gloves and that his gloves had a saturation of gunshot residue on it . officer ( samuel ) duncan 's revealed that he had no gunshot residue on his hands . '' but huerta 's family , like victor white 's family in louisiana , suspect foul play by police . the aftermath : hundreds of protesters took to the streets of durham to decry huerta 's death . some carried banners that read , `` fue matado por la policia '' or `` murdered by police . '' a vigil for huerta turned violent , with six people arrested . the police chief said that as a hispanic , he had trouble believing the allegations among the hispanic community that durham police unfairly target latinos . cnn 's eliott c. mclaughlin and nick valencia contributed to this report .	police say victor white iii and jesus huerta shot themselves while handcuffed in cars .  report : police ignored jorge azucena 's complaints that he had asthma and could n't breathe .  kelly thomas died five days after he was beaten by police in fullerton , california .	gray wavered in and out of a coma and died sunday , one week after his arrest . it 's not clear how he suffered the spinal cord injury . police in vineland , new jersey , responded to a call of a disorderly person , and white was arrested and handcuffed .
( cnn ) the third blood moon in a four-part series was the shortest eclipse of the bunch , but still a sweet treat for early risers in north america . the moon slipped fully into earth 's shadow at 4:58 a.m. pacific time ( 7:58 a.m . et ) saturday , starting a total lunar eclipse for nearly five minutes -- what nasa says will be the shortest such eclipse of the century . the celestial body took on a burnt-orange tint in the minutes before , during and after the total eclipse , giving the moon the appearance that earns total eclipses the `` blood moon '' nickname . watchers in the eastern half of north america caught only a partial eclipse -- and in some places , an orange one -- before the moon set below the horizon . the event started at 3:16 a.m. pt ( 6:16 a.m . et ) , when the moon began moving into earth 's shadow . `` the lunar eclipse is looking good !

( cnn ) we want our killers to be kind . to walk into court and show remorse , tell us that they are really nice people who only did it because they feared for their lives , or they were temporarily insane . even though those things may not be true , too often they are accepted as legitimate excuses for murder . well , aaron hernandez , the former new england patriots tight end and now convicted murderer , made none of those excuses . he walked into court with an air of bravado , his head held high like the $ 40 million , nfl superstar he was just a couple of years ago . several times he was even caught winking at his fiancee , shayanna jenkins , during the trial . and we did n't like his swagger . hernandez did n't offer a plausible alibi . he did n't look ashamed or remorseful . he never wept . his own attorney , james sultan , admitted that hernandez `` witnessed '' the killing of odin lloyd , `` committed by somebody he knew , '' but said his client did not commit the crime . even before the guilty verdict came down wednesday , for many -- at least those covering the trial -- audacity seemed to be the defendant 's biggest crime . `` the arrogance of aaron hernandez , '' a new yorker headline accused . i do n't get it . what does it matter that hernandez was arrogant in court , or walked with too much swagger , or even smiled at his girl ? like it or not , that is who he is . the evidence is what matters . and for once , this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision : guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 slaying of odin lloyd . hernandez , 25 , was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole . he was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition . it was the right decision . still , it 's hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both lloyd and now hernandez , who were once friends . football was the best thing hernandez ever had , especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in 2006 . hernandez was 16 . after that his life got complicated . at 17 , hernandez went off to the university of florida and seemed headed for greatness . there he won the john mackey award as the nation 's best tight end and led the team in receiving during its 2009 bowl championship series win . but off the field , his life was to beginning to unravel . trouble started : bar fights , reports of marijuana use and failed drug tests . he was even questioned in relation to a shooting after a fight at a gainesville , florida , nightclub . by the time he was drafted in 2010 by the new england patriots , hernandez had already been labeled a `` troubled player . '' but neither the patriots nor the nfl has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the hernandez case . they did everything right this time . hours after hernandez was charged with murder , he was let go from the team . and his coaches did n't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent , family-loving guy , as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble . this time justice worked . there 's no reason to second-guess what went wrong , to ask `` how could a star nfler be a murderer ? '' the nfl for the most part does a great job vetting its players , and certainly hernandez is an anomaly in the league , where despite the ugly headlines , the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding , law-abiding citizens . and patriots bashers ( me included ) would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting hernandez despite his troubled past . no one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others , even those closest to us . not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees , or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people , and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job . there was no way to predict hernandez would end up a murderer . he was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world , but he still went wrong . hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom : according to a law enforcement source close to the case , hernandez told officers escorting him , `` ' hey man , i 'm going to miss you guys . ... i do n't need any luck any more . ' he gave you the impression , ' it 's kinda like no big deal . ... it is what it is . ' ``	roxanne jones : jury right to find hernandez guilty , but the waste of life for player and his victim is tragic .  she says nfl , patriots knew his troubled past , but could not have predicted his actions , and both handled case well .	well , aaron hernandez , the former new england patriots tight end and now convicted murderer , made none of those excuses . his own attorney , james sultan , admitted that hernandez " witnessed " the killing of odin lloyd , " committed by somebody he knew , " but said his client did not commit the crime . hernandez , 25 , was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole .
washington ( cnn ) nearly 6 in 10 americans say that businesses that provide wedding-related services should be required to provide those services to same-sex couples in the same way they would all other customers , even if they have religious objections . a new cnn/orc poll finds 57 % feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples , while 41 % say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons . that 's a shift from a pew research center poll conducted last fall , which found just 49 % thought businesses ought to be required to serve same-sex couples while 47 % that they should be allowed to refuse service on religious grounds . since the pew poll last fall , indiana 's religious freedom restoration act , signed into law in late march by republican governor mike pence , sparked a nationwide controversy over whether the law allowed wedding-related businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples . apple , walmart and the ncaa all spoke out against the law , while some states and cities with democratic leaders barred spending public money in indiana . pence and other indiana legislators insisted discrimination was not the law 's intent and a bill to change the original law was signed in early april . in the cnn/orc poll , most democrats ( 70 % ) and independents ( 60 % ) say wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples as they would different-sex couples , while republicans break broadly the other way , 67 % say religious reasons are a valid justification for refusing service . full poll results . looking at republicans and independents who lean toward the republican party , 60 % in that group say wedding-related businesses should be allowed to refuse services to same-sex couples , but there are sharp divides within that group by age and ideology . moderate and liberal republicans and republican-leaners broadly say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve all couples the same way ( 58 % ) while three-quarters of conservative republicans favor allowing a caterer or florist to refuse service for religious reasons ( 74 % ) . among republicans and republican-leaning independents under age 50 , 56 % say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve same-sex and different-sex couples the same way while among those age 50 or older , 72 % think they should not be required to do so . the big gay wedding cake quiz . age differences hold across party lines , but the generation gap among republicans and republican-leaners is larger than that among democrats and democratic-leaning independents . overall , white evangelicals are broadly in favor of allowing businesses to refuse service for religious reasons - 62 % say they should be able to . but among whites who are not evangelicals , 61 % say such businesses should be required to provide services to all couples the same way . the shift from the pew center results comes across demographic lines . men , women , whites , younger adults and senior citizens all are more apt than in the pew poll to say wedding-related business should be required to serve same-sex couples as they do others . the cnn/orc international poll was conducted by telephone , april 16-19 , among a random national sample of 1,018 adult americans . results for the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points . michigan auto repair shop says yes to gun owners , no to homosexuals .	most americans say businesses should not discriminate against same-sex weddings .  public opinion has shifted on the issue since last fall .  indiana passed and later changed its religious freedom law after public outcry .	washington ( cnn ) nearly 6 in 10 americans say that businesses that provide wedding - related services should be required to provide those services to same - sex couples in the same way they would all other customers , even if they have religious objections . a new cnn / orc poll finds 57 % feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples , while 41 % say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons .
kano , nigeria ( cnn ) hundreds of decomposed corpses were discovered buried in shallow graves in the streets of the northeastern nigerian town of damasak this past weekend , according to local officials and a resident . the town had recently been freed from the boko haram terror group in a joint nigerian-chadian military operation . a provincial government committee was visiting the area as part of an effort to assess the level of destruction in towns that had been in the deadly grip of boko haram . `` we found hundreds of dead bodies in shallow graves and on the streets of damasak during our visit , '' damasak local government spokesman babagana mustapha told cnn on monday . `` those bodies in shallow graves have badly decomposed while those found on the streets were desiccated from [ exposure to ] dry ‎winds , '' mustapha added . the victims included men , women and children murdered by boko haram when they seized the area in november , said abubakar kyari , a senator-elect for the region . `` the staggering number of dead bodies found in damasak is a testimony of the large-scale atrocity boko haram committed when they were in control of the town '' kyari added . mustapha said the bodies were buried in 20 clearly marked mass graves . although mustapha did not give a precise number of corpses recovered , damasak residents who participated in the exhumations put the figure at more than 400 . `` ‎we collected over 400 corpses from the streets and in shallow graves during our visit in damasak , '' said idris karimbe , one of the volunteers who took part in the burial . `` the number of bodies we recovered this time around far exceeded the ones found last month , '' said another resident , musa bremah‎ . bremah was referring to the discovery of around 90 bodies in a shallow grave outside damasak last month after its recapture . ‎a regional military coalition involving troops from nigeria , niger , chad and cameroon has in recent months recaptured swathes of nigerien territory seized by boko haram . the joint military operation is part of an ongoing collaborative effort at crushing the islamist group that has widened its deadly attacks to niger , chad and cameroon .	the town had recently been freed from the boko haram terror group .  volunteer from burial : '' we collected over 400 corpses from the streets and in shallow graves ''	kano , nigeria ( cnn ) hundreds of decomposed corpses were discovered buried in shallow graves in the streets of the northeastern nigerian town of damasak this past weekend , according to local officials and a resident . the town had recently been freed from the boko haram terror group in a joint nigerian - chadian military operation .
washington ( cnn ) chief justice john roberts is back in the spotlight . roberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case . the u.s. supreme court will hear oral arguments tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry . the question at the core of obergefell v. hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century , and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race . appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage , but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation 's highest court , led by roberts . appointed to the bench by president george w. bush , roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage . he dissented in united states v. windsor , a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the defense of marriage act , which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples . and he 's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans . yet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice , and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally . they will be scrutinizing his words and actions tuesday for clues about how he 'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again . `` if the windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality , the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the roberts court , '' said judith e. schaeffer of the constitutional accountability center , which is advocating for same-sex marriage . `` will john roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision ? '' for some conservatives , a vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment . it would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when justice david souter , who was nominated to the bench by george h.w . bush and who retired in 2009 , consistently voted with the liberals or when justice anthony kennedy , a ronald reagan appointee , disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty . or when roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government 's taxing authority . the hope in conservative circles is that roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same-sex marriage gets decided by the people , not the courts . `` the chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the constitution , '' said edward whelan , president of the ethics and public policy center . `` blatherings about the ' wrong side of history ' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice . '' those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the windsor case . in his majority opinion , kennedy said the `` principal purpose '' of the defense of marriage act was to `` impose inequality . '' roberts disagreed . he wrote separately to say he thought congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide `` uniformity and stability '' at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman . roberts picked up on kennedy 's language that emphasized the states ' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday `` come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions . '' david cruz of the university of southern california gould school of law said that roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the obergefell case . `` roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage , '' cruz said . indeed , the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky in the obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage . another clue to roberts ' thinking in the windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the defense of marriage act was passed out of a desire to harm -- noting it had the support of majorities in both the house of representatives and the senate as well as president bill clinton , who signed it into law . `` i would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry , '' roberts wrote . the comments suggest he would reject an argument in the obergefell case that rested on the idea that same-sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people . but backers of same-sex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own . schaeffer points out that roberts did n't join the parts of the dissents penned by justices antonin scalia , clarence thomas and samuel alito , which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same-sex marriage do n't violate the constitution . `` roberts did n't join them in expressing those views , '' schaeffer said . at the time , roberts simply wrote that the court `` does not have before it , and the logic of its opinion does not decide '' whether states can ban same-sex marriage . schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that was n't before the court . `` but i think one reasonable explanation is that roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality , '' she said . the defense of marriage act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- hollingsworth v. perry -- that could have determined whether states could ban same-sex marriage . the case concerned a challenge to california 's proposition 8 , a state constitutional amendment that barred same-sex couples from marriage . but roberts , writing for the majority , dismissed the case , holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court . the ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated proposition 8 and thus paved the way for same-sex marriage in california . roberts ' lesbian cousin , who lives in california , sat in the courtroom during arguments in the prop 8 case . few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the supreme court , but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing windsor -- struck down the state bans . on the first day of the term last fall , the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue . conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases . but conventional wisdom was completely wrong . without comment , the court declined to take up any of the cases , clearing the way for thousands of additional same-sex marriages . the court 's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known . but some speculate on one possible scenario : roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in windsor . then again , even if the speculation were true , it does n't reveal much about roberts ' thinking . there 's a big difference between voting not to take up a case , which expresses no opinions on the merits , and issuing an opinion on the merits . and even when roberts ' actions -- such as effectively allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in california -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide , his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking . `` when the institution of marriage developed historically , people did n't get around and say , ' let 's have this institution , but let 's keep out homosexuals , ' `` roberts said during the proposition 8 oral arguments . `` the institution developed to serve purposes that , by their nature , did n't include homosexual couples . ''	john roberts is at judicial crossroads as high court to hear key same-sex marriage case .  case could decide whether same-sex couples nationwide have constitutional right to marry .  chief justice disappointed conservatives earlier when he helped uphold obamacare .	washington ( cnn ) chief justice john roberts is back in the spotlight . the u.s . supreme court will hear oral arguments tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry . for some conservatives , a vote in favor of same - sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment .
( cnn ) jackson gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old . by day he is an industrial design student at philadelphia university , but gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker , tougher and more enigmatic . hanging in his workshop gordon has a full suit of armor plating , cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife . gordon has an alter ego : the dark knight himself , batman . you might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery , but speaking to cnn gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place . gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay . `` previously i 'd been involved with costume making ... i 'd made a version of the batsuit from christopher nolan 's ' dark knight trilogy ' and i really liked that suit , '' gordon says . but , as elaborate as his design was , it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article . `` i was frustrated every time i wore it , '' gordon explains . `` it really limited my mobility and i did n't like that -- it did n't go with the character . '' in september 2014 he bit the bullet , deciding `` to do another one that would n't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like batman 's actual suit . '' the batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife , the impact of a punch or a baseball bat , but light and articulate enough to make it practical . striking such a balance required expensive materials , and they did n't come cheap . gordon therefore fired up a kickstarter campaign . he `` did n't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it '' -- he raised $ 1,255 in 6 days . `` it was a little surprising , '' gordon demurs . writing out his shopping list , it was important that `` everywhere , even places without armor plating , had some sort of protection . '' kevlar was sourced as the base fabric , making it `` cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons , but breathable and wearable all day . '' eschewing conventional materials , gordon opted for a form of memory foam , built around key areas to `` squish and compress , '' dissipating the impact of blows . after much experimenting with `` polycarbonates and extruded pvc materials , '' ¼ '' kydex ( or abs ) plastic formed the tough armor plates , located on the torso , forearms and shins . stab resistant , gordon says `` it can take anything but a gunshot . '' the cowl was more problematic , being `` nearly impossible '' to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop . gordon therefore took a mold of his head using sintra plastic , `` working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable batman shape . '' using a two part box mold gordon was able to create a `` silicone jacket '' of this , into which liquid polyurethane was poured , forming the final , `` durable and functional '' cowl . gordon ( who does n't appear to be related to gotham city 's police commissioner , james gordon ) is also an expert in shaolin kung fu : he is both brains and brawn , a cross between bruce wayne and batsuit designer lucius fox from nolan 's batman trilogy . legendary , the production company behind the films , has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval . the batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty . `` people love the theatricality of it , '' its designer says . that the product so closely mimics dc 's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance . he has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public , with `` fully adjustable '' jackets going up for sale on his site armatus design `` in the next couple of weeks . '' the jackets have received particular attention . gordon has received `` easily over 50 requests from people , '' and not just from the cosplay community . `` they range from recreational use to martial artists ... but also motorcycle and all terrain vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [ gordon 's ] suit . '' perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues , those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol . gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he 's at university -- he has to finish he studies after all , and wo n't be using the project towards his degree credits . for now the batsuit and armatus design will remain a one man operation : such is the life of a superhero .	21-year-old student jackson gordon has designed and built a functional batsuit .  made with money raised on kickstarter , the outfit has received a prestigious endorsement .

washington ( cnn ) an off-duty member of the uniformed division of secret service was arrested friday in washington and charged with first-degree attempted burglary , a felony , and one misdemeanor count for destruction of property , the d.c. metropolitan police department reported . arthur baldwin , 29 , was arrested at a woman 's residence in southeast washington , according to documents provided by the police department . he has been placed on administrative leave and his security clearance has been suspended , the secret service said . baldwin is assigned to the foreign missions branch , according to u.s. secret service spokesman brian leary . that branch is responsible for working with the diplomatic community in washington . a police officer went to a residence about 12:24 a.m. after receiving a call about a burglary in progress , police documents said . the officer found the front door with broken hinges , boot prints and two broken windows , the documents say . the woman who lives there told the officer , `` my ex-boyfriend wo n't leave me alone . '' while the d.c. metropolitan police officer was at the scene , baldwin drove up , said he was a police officer and asked to speak with the woman , the police document said . when asked if he kicked in the door , baldwin said , `` i kicked the door but did not ... break the windows , '' the document said . when a cnn reporter asked for a comment friday during an arraignment , baldwin said , `` no , you 'll get me in trouble .

irbil , iraq ( cnn ) isis claimed it controlled part of iraq 's largest oil refinery sunday , posting images online that purported to show the storming of the facility , fierce clashes and plumes of smoke rising above the contested site . the group said it launched an assault on the baiji oil refinery late saturday . by sunday , isis said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings , but iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted iraqi forces remain in full control . cnn could n't independently verify isis ' claim . it would n't be the first time that militants and iraqi forces have battled over the refinery , a key strategic resource that has long been a lucrative target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by iraqis domestically . if an attack damaged oil fields or machinery , it could have a significant impact . the refinery is just 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) from the northern iraqi city of tikrit , which iraqi forces and shiite militias wrested from isis less than two weeks ago . cnn 's jennifer deaton and catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .	isis says it controls several buildings at the baiji oil refinery .  iraqi government security officials say iraqi forces remain in full control .  the refinery , iraq 's largest , has long been a lucrative target for militants .	the group said it launched an assault on the baiji oil refinery late saturday . by sunday , isis said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings , but iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted iraqi forces remain in full control .
( cnn ) hillary clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election . although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months , there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement . for democrats , there is ample reason to be excited about clinton 's run for the presidency . she is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades . she brings to the table extensive political and policy experience , a combination of skills that is often lacking . she has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before . she has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media , how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies . she is a hardened , tough partisan who will not shy away from republican attack . americans have many positive memories of clinton name , given the booming economy of the late 1990s during bill clinton 's presidency . if hillary clinton puts together an effective campaign , she could be unbeatable in the democratic primaries as well as in the general election . however , during the buildup to her final decision , some of her weaknesses have also been exposed . clinton does n't want to end up like vice president al gore in 2000 . although he did relatively well in the final election ( with many americans believing that he did actually defeat george w. bush ) he did n't generate much energy once the campaign started . although he too was touted as a `` perfect '' candidate who was the ideal person for the job , something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail . he seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling . gore had trouble connecting with voters , and he seemed to remake his image constantly . his biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee , rather than what he actually stood for . clinton must avoid following gore 's path . she suffered this fate in the 2008 primaries and ca n't afford to do so again . she needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience . that is not enough . more important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the white house . voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents , even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change . a recent story in the washington post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability . after the announcement , they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as iowa and new hampshire . clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity . in his first day on the campaign trail , sen. rand paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted . that question has dogged the clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s . their greatest virtue , their immense skills as politicians , has often come back to haunt them . bill clinton was attacked as `` slick willie '' by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and hillary clinton has faced similar criticism . when she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in iraq , many democrats did n't buy her critique of president george w. bush 's foreign policies and went for barack obama instead . when she conducted her `` listening tour '' of new york before running for the senate , many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider . when she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her state department email , some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she was n't always telling us what she was really about . even if she is n't hiding anything , she often gives that appearance . during the next few months , clinton will also have to connect with her party 's base . the ongoing speculation about sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the democratic party is not that enthused with clinton 's candidacy . while they will probably vote for her , they are not very motivated and do n't trust that she will stand for democratic values . she will need to address these concerns , not through her style but through her agenda . voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing . she will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with iran . clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large . without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments -- about her appearance , for instance -- that wo n't be aimed at male candidates . part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism . but the struggle will be tough . finally , and this relates to the last challenge , clinton will have to contend with her husband . to be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail , one of the most compelling democrats of our generation . but he can also be liability . as she learned in 2008 , bill clinton is not always easy to control . when he speaks his mind , as he did in dismissive comments about obama 's candidacy , it can often work against her . the fund-raising records of the clinton foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest , and ongoing stories about his personal life , as was the case when monica lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago , could re-emerge on the campaign trail . whether that is fair or not is beside the point : everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail . hillary clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate . but she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months .	julian zelizer : hillary clinton has immense political and governmental experience .  he says she needs to make stronger connection to her party 's base .  clinton also needs to convince voters of her authenticity , zelizer says .

( cnn ) the world 's seventh-largest economy is heading toward collapse . an economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $ 24 trillion , one that annually churns out the equivalent of $ 2.5 trillion , is under assault . however , i am not referring to one of the g8 economies , but to the `` super economy '' of the ocean . it 's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast . the health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a wwf report released thursday , reviving the ocean economy . the report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by the boston consulting group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the global change institute of the university of queensland . true , the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal . but it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations . the fact is that the ocean feeds us , employs us , offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world . the ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity , such as climate regulation and oxygen production , that are difficult to put in monetary terms . and while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives , no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us . a figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling : seventy percent of the ocean 's overall economic value relies on its continued health . ocean assets like fisheries , coral reefs , mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world 's top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them . that may seem like a far-off possibility to some , but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report . for example , 90 percent of the world 's fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited . and that is not all . by 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs , which have already been halved in the last few decades . this is n't just a concern for dive enthusiasts , but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks . the ocean is truly too big to fail . the loss of the ocean 's critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage . fortunately , our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy , three of which are critical this year . first , the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well-being . also , negotiators meeting in paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change . and finally , leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years . the economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear , and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy . reviving the ocean economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome , but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers . all this said , and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean 's health has been its fastest in millions of years , there is actually some ( potential ) good news : if we act swiftly and with determination , marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly . many local examples -- from the mediterranean to the mozambique channel , from the fiji archipelago to the arctic -- show us that conservation , restoration and sustainable-use approaches mean the ocean , and the people who depend on it , can both prosper . ultimately , the ocean bridges continents , connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource . but if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return , we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate . after all , it 's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces .	ocean economic powerhouse valued at $ 24 trillion : wwf report .  marco lambertini : ocean plays direct role in livelihoods across globe .

( cnn ) as thousands of south africans took to the streets of the city of durban to rally against violence and xenophobia , an online community has joined the protests . the marches follow recent violent attacks on foreigners in the country that have claimed five lives . during the protest march thursday , twitter followers voiced their support through hashtag campaigns . # peacemarch and # saynotoxenophobia were some of the most popular . south african police services said more than 10,000 people attended the march , including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations . hashtags are now pouring out of south africa . but many are asking , some via twitter , is it enough to fight # xenophobia ? attacks this week in durban alone have killed two immigrants and three south africans , including a 14-year-old boy , authorities said . for south african tim flack , tweeting was n't going to make a bit of difference . flack , who lives in cape town , has brought allegations of hate speech and human rights violations against zulu king goodwill zwelithini , who he said referred to foreigners as `` lice '' and has said `` they should pack their bags and go . '' `` people listen to him , '' flack said . `` he is a monarch . the zulu people in south africa take him very seriously , they do n't question what he says . '' flack said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they were n't enough . so he filed a complaint with the south african human rights commission , and then tweeted about it . `` the activists sit around feeling accomplished because they retweeted five times , '' flack said . `` i want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it wo n't cost them anything , but i will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being . '' now , the human rights commission must decide whether to investigate flack 's allegations against the king , who denies fueling any violence . flack hopes others will also make complaints . flack added that zulus are n't the only people in south africa who share in the xenophobic sentiment . `` people are frustrated and unemployed , and people in south africa pay foreign nationals a lot less , '' he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants . `` a domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house , whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand , so it causes resentment . '' imtiaz sooliman , founder and chairman of the gift of givers foundation in durban , does n't think most south africans are against foreigners . `` south africans are against xenophobia , '' said sooliman , who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals . gift of givers has been administering assistance at five refugee camps set up by the south african government that now hold roughly 8,000 foreign national refugees , he said , passing out things like clothing and hygiene packs . the organization posts its work at the camps online and tags it on social media with # xenophobia . why ? `` in south africa , everyone knows xenophobia , '' sooliman said , `` and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand . so if you say # tsunami or # war , people follow it . so here , people say # xenophobia , and they all know what it is -- it is a disaster , so you are going to post what people understand .

( cnn ) the powers of marvel 's all-star superheroes go a bit wobbly in `` avengers : age of ultron . '' faced with the daunting prospect of topping the surprise and excitement of 2012 's the avengers , the third highest-grossing film of all time , writer-director joss whedon mixes some brooding down-time in with the abundant spectacle . to be sure , series junkies will get their fix from the sheer massiveness of the exploits , but at least two of the big action scenes are lackluster , while the climax and resolution could have been worked out in more complex , less rote ways , so as to further increase intrigue and anticipation for `` avengers : infinity war parts 1 and 2 , '' already scheduled for release in may of 2018 and 2019 , respectively . not that any of this will matter much , since the pent-up excitement among the enormous international fan base is so intense that nothing will keep the summer 's presumed biggest franchise blockbuster from soaring to and beyond the one-billion dollar threshold internationally . hands-on producer kevin feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in hollywood history , a veritable solar system of staggeringly profitable individual franchises unified by the overpowering collective force of the avengers . so while sideline enterprises like the new `` daredevil '' tv series continue to pop up , the company can be so confident in the enduring appeal of its theatrical mainstays that it recently published a release schedule for its remaining big-gun commercial titles from now through the end of the decade . at this point , no one would be willing to bet on when a sense of terminal deja vu might set in to bring it all to an end , and comic-con can plan its main events years ahead . in the meantime , the key points of interest surround how many surprises and twists can be wrung from a format and set of expectations that demand great fealty from core fans ; any significant deviations are taken as personal betrayals by the hardest-core geeks . last summer , `` guardians of the galaxy '' showed that marvel could play it a bit more fast and loose than it generally does , but the big-name franchises still seem sacrosanct . and so it is with `` avengers : age of ultron , '' which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different . picking up where last year 's `` captain america : winter soldier '' left off , the new film , without preamble , dives right in to show the avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty hydra organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves clint barton/hawkeye ( jeremy renner ) worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries , twins pietro and wanda ( aaron-taylor johnson and elizabeth olsen ) . victory allows for some passably amusing scenes of the heroes blowing off steam : the favorite party trick of thor ( chris hemsworth ) is to challenge all comers to lift up his hammer ; natasha/black widow ( scarlett johansson ) and bruce banner/the hulk ( mark ruffalo ) pursue a little mating dance in which her amorous interest is predicated upon his retaining his human rather than superhero form ; and tony stark/iron man ( robert downey jr. ) and steve rogers/captain america ( chris evans ) take stock of the advances their old nazi nemesis strucker ( thomas kretschmann ) appears to be making in the artificial intelligence department , specifically with the most sophisticated humanoid ever devised , ultron ( voiced with marvelous robotic nuance by james spader ) . what 's behind warner bros. ' risky move to release nine movies . ultron is a cool and sophisticated creation ; what he lacks , of course , is a heart , which is what makes him such an imposing villain . a sleekly designed robot you might even call handsome , he makes an excellent intellectual and smart-ass sparring partner for stark , but when he first appears , he 's still on training wheels . however , he does recruit pietro and wanda to his cause , an easy matter since stark killed their parents . he 's not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but , in their first skirmish with him , the avengers are sufficiently outclassed to begin worrying . could ' star wars ' open at $ 500 million ? licking their wounds at the `` safe house '' of hawkeye 's farm , the avengers go into a funk . the impatient thor quickly takes off `` to find answers , '' bruce resists natasha 's desire to get something physical cooking between them ; stark , lamenting that `` ultron is tryng to tear us apart , '' consults with old cohort nick fury ( samuel l. jackson , briefly ) , while mad men 's linda cardellini , playing hawkeye 's stand-by-your-man wife , is stuck with the ( intentionally ? ) funniest line of dialogue in the film : `` you know i totally support your avenging . '' while some of his partners wallow in disarray , captain america heads for seoul , where the next evolutionary step is to emerge via a device called `` the cradle , '' which will hatch mass-produced android soldiers that will pave the way for ultron 's world domination . but a major chase through the city involving a runaway subway train falls flat due to basic conceptual silliness and poor action continuity . of course , the avengers ultimately get it together to do the kind of butt-kicking they 're supposed to do , and a very welcome addition to the team comes in the form of the android called vision . red-faced and green-garbed , vision is given a striking profile and overall presence by paul bettany ( heretofore limited in the marvel world to vocal work as stark 's computerized butler j.a.r.v.i.s . ) , and it can be hoped , if not assumed , that this most intriguing character will play an even more important role in the final two avengers installments . ' galaxy quest ' tv series in the works . ultimately , whedon 's efforts to invest the heroes with a degree of uncertainty and vulnerability comes off as half-baked , as such an effort can only go so far due to the nature of the material . after all , these are comic book characters defined by their double identities ; a third dimension is neither required nor perhaps even desired . if ending on a dramatic cliffhanger note had been desired , the elements were there for the taking ; including a semi-tragic component along with mystery about ultron 's ultimate fate would arguably have only further cranked up anticipation for the coming chapters . but , then , what does that matter when the automatic attendance of millions is assured ? `` avengers : age of ultron '' succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do , but this time the action scenes do n't always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic no-man's-land . the returning series actors acquit themselves in the expected agreeable manner , while series newcomer andy serkis has a terrific couple of minutes as a tough but stressed south african criminal . ©2015 the hollywood reporter . all rights reserved .	` avengers : age of ultron ' hits theaters may 1 .  critic : movie does n't quite measure up to the original from 2012 .

( cnn ) a south african university is celebrating the removal of a british colonialist 's statue after weeks of protests . university of cape town students took to social media to demand cecil rhodes ' statue come down , saying his legacy is tainted with racism . using the hashtag # rhodesmustfall , students expressed their views in a campaign that started last month . four weeks later , the hashtag is now # rhodeshas fallen . the university said wednesday the heritage authority granted it permission to remove the statue from the campus . `` these steps are being taken to ensure the safety of the statue while matters concerning its future are resolved , '' the university said in a statement . rhodes ' statue was first unveiled in 1934 at the university , which also has a scholarship and memorial in his name . # rhodesmustfall gained attention after activists threw excrement on the statue in march . `` he represents the former colonial representation of this country -- supremacy , racism , misogyny , '' says ramabina mahapa , president of the students ' representative council , which led the fight to remove the statue . `` students are saying these are n't the ideals that we want to have here , '' mahapa says . `` the statue represents what is wrong with society .

( cnn ) emy afalava is a loyal american and decorated veteran . he was born in american samoa , a u.s. territory since 1900 . he has been subject to american law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen . the constitution would agree . the fourteenth amendment declares that `` all persons born ... in the united states , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the united states . '' yet , afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen . how can it be , in the 21st century , that americans born on u.s. soil are denied the rights of citizenship ? that injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of american samoa to join the united states . it is a wrong that afalava and other american samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the d.c . circuit . a decision could come any day . since the united states was established , it adhered to the rule that those born on u.s. lands were u.s. citizens . the rule is colorblind , yet the only exception that the supreme court has ever declared was not . the infamous dred scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free african-americans had `` no rights that the white man was bound to respect . '' though they were americans , they were not citizens under the constitution . a civil war later , the 14th amendment reversed the ruling in the dred scott case . today , the dred scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the supreme court . but racial discrimination did n't end there . in 1904 , a puerto rican woman named isabel gonzalez sailed for new york . because puerto rico was u.s. territory , she believed herself to be a u.s. citizen . but officials at ellis island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland . she sued , with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling . yet the supreme court that eventually heard gonzalez 's case was still racist . in preceding years , for example , it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the chinese race . and , in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as puerto rico , the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class u.s. territories . justice edward douglas white 's opinion stated that u.s. sovereignty extended over them , but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other americans . he did so , he privately revealed , because `` he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions . '' in the gonzalez case , the justices agreed unanimously that puerto ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws . but they declined to decide whether or not gonzalez was a citizen . though preoccupied by fears that islanders were `` savages '' and racially unfit for citizenship , they were unwilling to violate the constitution . as a result of the court ruling , federal officials were able to deny gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years . as isabel gonzalez 's lawyer told the court , declaring that residents of america 's island territories are not u.s. citizens would mean adding to `` precedents in our history of which we are least proud . '' those precedents , he warned the court , had been `` repudiated by the american people in the civil war , by three amendments to the constitution of the united states , by this court , and by ... advancing civilization . '' surely , 147 years after the dred scott case was overturned , the time has come to put an end to this farce . in the past century , the inhabitants of every other u.s. island territory have become citizens . today , emy afalava and his fellow american samoans are the last americans still waiting to become citizens .	emy afalava is a loyal american and decorated veteran ; he 's also an american samoan .  sam erman and nathan perl-rosenthal : it is outrageous that he and others like him are denied citizenship .	he was born in american samoa , a u.s . territory since 1900 . yet , afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen . today , the dred scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the supreme court .
( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use . heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health . the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men . binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month . the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found . in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men . nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men . opinion : why are more women drinking ? `` it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , '' said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study . `` it 's really , really scary . '' the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level . in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers . despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found . madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent . hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) . related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink . about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year . the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol . she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years . still , she noted , `` there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui . they think they have control over it . '' public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking . as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute . young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more . so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said . taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said . alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years . a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 . alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said . that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where `` blue laws '' once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets . to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control . kaiser health news ( khn ) is a nonprofit national health policy news service .	heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 .  the increase is driven largely by women 's drinking habits .  it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , says one expert .	heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health . the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found .

'' apparently so was slager 's attorney , who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer . after the video became public , the officials in north charleston deftly handled the situation . however , it was an easy case . there is no plausible evidence that slager feared for his life when scott is seen running away . in ferguson , the video we have in the death of michael brown is of press conferences with police chief tom jackson , who refused to release the police officer 's name , but did release a video that appeared to show michael brown stealing cigars . we have the video of the military weapons deployed by the police in ferguson that were trained on its residents and the press . the world seethed . north charleston 's police force is about 80 % white , with a population of 47 % black and 37 % white in the city . ferguson 's police force is 94 % white ( only three of the 53 police officers are black ) , and the city is 67 % black and 29 % white . both north charleston and ferguson have police forces that are not representative of the population they serve , yet because of a video north charleston 's police force got in front of the story . i 'm not sure north charleston gets here without learning something from the mistakes of ferguson . i have heard many commentators say the north charleston shooting does n't have anything to do with race . i do n't buy it . i wonder how many whites in north charleston with broken taillights get pulled over ? being pulled over for driving while black is a well-known phenomenon , which i discuss in my `` critical race theory '' casebook . racial profiling by slager could have been the catalyst for scott being pulled over in the first place . yes , the north charleston officials behaved differently than the officials in ferguson . i do n't think it 's because race had nothing to do with it . it is that perhaps the north charleston officials are better than those in ferguson when it comes to racially charged situations -- especially given the instructive fallout from brown 's shooting . and , of course , the video . it remains to be seen whether slager will be convicted of murder . strange things can happen in a jury room . recall how the rodney king videotape allowed a simi valley , california , jury to acquit the los angeles police officers , but a federal jury later convicted the officers of violating king 's civil rights . what a video proves can sometimes be in the eye of the beholder .	dorothy brown : shooting by cop might have followed usual narrative of blaming black suspects .  but video in walter scott 's fatal shooting showed the truth , brown says .  with hindsight from michael brown case , north charleston did the right thing with arrest .

( cnn ) one of tokyo 's most prominent districts has taken a small , but potentially significant step to recognizing same-sex unions in japan . the government of shibuya ward , one of the capital 's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts , passed ordinance on wednesday paving the way for `` partnership certificates '' for same-sex couples , allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples . same-sex partners who are registered with the district 's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements . other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy , such as joint filing of taxes , are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities . the measure was proposed in february by shibuya 's mayor , toshitake kuwahara . while the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding , proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative japan say that the ward 's decision is a step in the right direction . `` it is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing , '' gon matsunaka , a gay rights activist , told cnn . while shibuya 's decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage , the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities . `` what is important for the lgbt ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community in shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society , '' matsunaka said . `` it could be a strong driver for shibuya citizens to learn and know what kind of problems lgbt people are facing . '' taiga ishikawa , tokyo councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in japan , told cnn the ordinance was a `` big first step for the protection of human rights . '' he called the decision `` happy '' but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles . he said that the most important part of today 's announcement is that it `` should be actually put into practice , as should education for understanding ( lgbt individuals ) especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young . '' neighboring setagaya ward has indicated that it would look into following shibuya 's lead . however , former councilor ishikawa cautioned against taking the movement 's momentum for granted . `` to realize equal rights for gay couples , a national law has to be made , '' he said . while outright discrimination against the lgbt community is rare in japan , its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage . many hide their sexuality from their employers , co-workers , families and friends . but the tide may be turning . a recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4 % oppose gay marriage , but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70 % . an editorial in the asahi shimbun newspaper , which commissioned the poll , welcomed the shibuya decision , calling it `` a bold and important step forward . '' only traditional marriages are recognized under japan 's constitution , but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation , according to mari miura , a professor of gender and politics at sophia university in tokyo . `` the constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage , so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional , '' miura told bloomberg business . while prime minister shinzo abe and the ruling liberal democratic party `` do n't like the idea of same-sex marriage , but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum . '' conservative groups were vocal in their opposition , with one , known as the network pushing for normalization of education , telling the japan times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other japanese citizens would degrade the `` familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history . '' while shibuya 's registration system will be a first for japan , yodogawa ward in the western japanese city of osaka was the first in the nation to recognize and support the lgbt community . in 2013 the ward government pledged to give consideration to the issues that the community faced , and to train staff to accommodate needs specific to lgbt individuals . journalist chie kobayashi contributed reporting from tokyo .	shibuya ward in tokyo passes an ordinance that gives same-sex couples some of the rights of married heterosexual couples .  activists welcome the decision ; hope that it will lead to greater equality for lgbt people in japan .  recent poll finds most young japanese open to the idea of gay marriage .

( cnn ) a sweat-smothered man in a wide-brimmed hat , knee-high leather boots and a khaki uniform machetes his way through lush jungle foliage . as thick tangles of vine fall beneath his blade , he pushes into a clearing , then suddenly staggers back . the fanged mouth of a primordial stone beast gapes toward him . before him rise the crumbled ruins of an enormous portal of rock , black with age but with a colossal grandeur not yet lost -- a fine example of what archaeologists call a `` zoomorphic portal '' or , more popularly , a `` monster mouth gate . '' what was once the gateway to an ancient mayan city , built circa 700 ad and mysteriously abandoned four centuries later , stands before him . he has found the lost city of lagunita . now that the planet has been mapped , circumnavigated , measured and tagged in every way imaginable , the age of explorers discovering new worlds seems a quaint memory . but there are still adventurers exploring forgotten corners of the globe , and some find astonishing things . one such explorer , part indiana jones , part magellan , is slovenian archaeologist ivan šprajc . the sprightly šprajc wears the weathered face of a man who has spent much of his 60 years beneath a hot sun at excavations , or hacking his way through dense jungle . he has been the first to see ancient pyramids , 30 meters high , that he spotted in aerial photographs from his office among the baroque mitteleuropean cobbled streets of ljubljana , slovenia , some 10,000 kilometers away . but in terms of the thrill of discovery , it does n't get any better than his encounter with lagunita 's monster portal . what does it feel like to find a lost city ? `` it 's a victory , '' says šprajc , `` especially when the efforts are long . on several occasions we 've had two , three weeks of just cutting through the bush to get to some location , without knowing what we would find . when we get to the site it feels like a big victory , like we 've done it . if it had been easy , then other people would have done it already . '' since 1996 , he and his team have discovered more than 80 ancient mayan cities in the jungles of mexico , few of which the modern world had known before . but how can an entire city , which once may have been home to tens of thousands , simply vanish ? šprajc explains that the region in which he has found such riches had gone unexplored because it 's so inaccessible : `` it 's so hard to get there . it 's a biosphere , a protected natural area that has never been densely populated since the collapse of the classical mayans , for the past thousand years or so . '' when a primal jungle is allowed to grow rampant for centuries , it can indeed swallow entire cities . but just why so many settlements were simply abandoned , long before the arrival of the spanish conquistadors , remains a mystery to which these long lost sites may provide an answer . `` ninety-nine percent of settlements in the central and southern lowlands of the yucatan peninsula were abandoned in a matter of 200 years . by 1000 ad , practically everything was abandoned . that was the situation when the spaniards came . but not so in the northern section of the peninsula and the guatemala highlands , where there was no rupture until the arrival of the spaniards . '' so what happened in that enormous area that led to this mass evacuation ? `` nobody knows the exact sequence of events , but it was definitely a combination of droughts , climate change , ( and ) overpopulation , but other things must have come as consequences : devastating raids and wars among the mayan states , which resembled the constantly battling ancient greek city-states . `` in this late classical period , wars intensified with devastating consequences , for if one city-state was destroyed or overcome , it had a ripple effect on trade networks . it was a sort of globalized mayan world . '' to learn more would require extensive , time-consuming surveys of each site , which is a different sort of fieldwork than šprajc likes to practice . his team will map what appears to be the core of a settlement , but there simply is n't time or manpower to map it all , so hundreds of structures are left for others to survey and excavate . the adrenaline of the treasure hunt is what drives šprajc , the `` eureka '' moment when he finds the buried treasure . he is not in the least proprietary about what he discovers , preferring to let other research teams dive in to the sites he has found to slowly excavate , catalogue and analyze what he finds . `` [ this extensive mapping ] is not our job . we are taking the first step into an unknown area . '' šprajc is a throwback to the great 19th century explorers -- a dying breed as the world becomes smaller and science bleaches out its mysteries . but in the heat of the jungle , science can only get you so far . intrepid spirit , calloused palms , sweat , blood and patience are more important than gadgetry . as šprajc likes to say , `` we can survive without computers , but not without machetes . '' noah charney is a professor of art history and best-selling author . he teaches a guardian masterclass called `` how to write about art .
