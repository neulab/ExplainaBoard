Until the mid - 1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known , both members of the crown group , from the early Devonian ( Emsian ) period . Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age , about 505 million years ago in the mid - Cambrian period . All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows , far more than the 8 typical of living species . They also appear to have had internal organ - like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores . One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth , apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular . Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian , but perhaps very different from modern species \u2013 for example one fossil ' s comb - rows were mounted on prominent vanes .

For example , 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors , whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6 . The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory : any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering . The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization , e . g . , 3 , 1 \u00b7 3 , 1 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 3 , etc . are all valid factorizations of 3 .", "answers": {"answer_start": [-1], "text": ["because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization"]}}, {"id": "0", "question": "What is the name of the property that designates a number as being prime or not ?", "context": "The property of being prime ( or not ) is called primality .
