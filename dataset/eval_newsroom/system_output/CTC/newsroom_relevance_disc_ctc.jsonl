{"src": "A worker sets up a polling station the morning of the GOP primary in Florida . Fewer voters than expected turned out . Editor 's note : John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast . He is co-editor of the book `` Deadline Artists : America 's Greatest Newspaper Columns . '' ( CNN ) -- Beneath Rick Santorum 's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo : Republican turnout is down . I 'm talking embarrassingly , disturbingly , hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad . It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file , and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election . Here 's the tale of the tape , state by state , beginning with Tuesday night : Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first , not a distant third as he did Tuesday night . In Colorado , more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000 . And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out , less than half the number who did four years ago . Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field , turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined . In Iowa , a little more than 121,000 people voted , compared with nearly 119,000 four years before , when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention . In New Hampshire , the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012 , compared with 241,000 four years before , despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47 % of the total turnout in 2012 , according to CNN exit polls . Take out the independent voters and you 've got a deep net decline . Always proudly rebellious , South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle . With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state , turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before . But in Florida , the decline became unmistakable . Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns , plus super PACS , spent more than $ 18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads , of which 93 % were negative in the last week alone , according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group . After all , negative ads depress turnout . But after all the mud was thrown , 1.6 million people turned out in the nation 's fourth largest state , which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008 . Nevada was even worse , with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans . Four years before , more than 44,300 participated in the caucus . Turnout was down more than 25 % despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town . Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000 . All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP . Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date , the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file . The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date . The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state 's Republican Party . For all the grass-roots romanticism , there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee . But the news is worst for Romney , long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line . `` Reluctantly Romney '' could be a bumper sticker , even for his supporters . The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35 % in national polls , meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field . His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before , when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field , although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012 . You reap what you sow , and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization . The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history . Therefore , it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before , when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race . A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout . But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates . Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options . Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed . Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates , including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal , than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election . Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election . The bottom line is that voter turnout matters . And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election . It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party . The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long , but the fact remains -- voters just are n't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012 .

{"src": "On television nowadays , drinking is the password for anyone desperate for social approval . And there is no better example than the Esquire Network , which began in September and has several tough-sounding new series , including `` Boundless , '' `` Knife Fight '' and `` Brew Dogs , '' that are actually lifestyle shows genteel enough to appeal to the probable target audience of moneyed metrosexuals . The stars of the Esquire Network are long-distance runners , chefs , beer brewers , fashion gurus and actors , but they all talk about their next drink with relish and swagger : wine , Champagne , craft beer , vodka , scotch , tequila shots , moonshine and even absinthe . It 's not so much thirst that drives the conversation on cable as it is male insecurity . For many channels , but especially for Esquire , which is trying to avoid being dismissed as Lifetime for men , alcohol is the badge of belonging , a liquid demonstration of youthful hipness , New Age machismo , and of being a `` dude '' or a `` bro '' or , as a South African canoe champion says on `` Boundless , '' using the preferred local term , a `` bru '' ( which , as it happens , rhymes with brew ) . A few women are allowed in the club . Aisha Tyler , an actress who is the celebrity tour guide of a recent episode of `` The Getaway , '' chose Paris as her weekend destination because , as she put it , `` I want to eat beautiful food and drink myself silly . '' She does . That kind of barroom boasting is not quite as common on network television anymore ; many of the kinds of shows that once celebrated binge drinking , if only to seem as racy as premium cable , have backed off a bit . A key plotline of the new season of `` Chicago Fire '' ( NBC ) involves the widow of a young fireman who kills her friend in a drunken-driving incident and goes to jail . `` Mom '' is a new CBS comedy about a mother-and-daughter team of former addicts who are in Alcoholics Anonymous . After Charlie Sheen left `` Two and a Half Men , '' on CBS , the creator killed off his hard-drinking character . ( That may have been too cold turkey : this season , the writers introduced his daughter , who seems to have inherited some of her father 's bad habits . ) The restraint is relative , and not necessarily a sign that a Puritan revival is spreading across networks . The message that drinking and driving do n't mix has sunk in , certainly , but mostly , alcohol jokes seem old hat , and writers prefer the once taboo subjects of marijuana and masturbation . The Esquire Network has to compete with more established cable brands like Bravo and Discovery . Esquire magazine , of course , has a well-established identity , but even it is often defined by what it 's not : Playboy without the centerfolds , The New Yorker without the writers . Most of Esquire 's television fare offers tamer escapism than hit series like `` The Deadliest Catch . '' And it is far less gonzo than almost anything on Vice , a magazine with a YouTube offshoot that is sometimes carried by HBO and offers off-kilter documentaries about places like North Korea . On Esquire , drinking is the bond that assures viewers that , however fit , disciplined and refined , its heroes are still very much the lads . ( Also , some of the top sponsors include Jose Cuervo and Grey Goose vodka . ) The hosts of `` Boundless , '' two Canadian endurance athletes , Simon Donato and Turbo Trebilcock , go to literally marathon lengths to gin up the gin , even in remote and unboozy locations like Angkor Wat in Cambodia . There , they enter a six-day , 230-kilometer marathon , and even in that unendurably hot and humid climate , amid chanting Buddhist monks , there is drinking . A German competitor guzzles a beer at every aid station , though most of the hard-core consumption is committed by a merry group of Indian runners who like to party . `` Guess we needed a couple more whiskeys before we started , '' one of them , Manoj , says roguishly after a so-so running time on Day 1 . `` Brew Dogs '' does n't need to work as hard to press the point . It 's a show that follows James Watt and Martin Dickie , two young Scottish craft brewers , as they travel across America , seeking unusual ways to create artisanal beers . ( The Proclaimers ' song `` I 'm Gon na Be ( 500 Miles ) '' is n't their theme song , but it should be . ) Perhaps because there is nothing quite as tedious as a man describing the nuanced notes of hops , the Scots go to macho extremes , including brewing a Colonial-style ale with corn , molasses and elements distilled from a copy of the Declaration of Independence , while atop a float in a Fourth of July parade in Pottstown , Pa. ( They also coax a young woman fresh from yoga class to sip their doughnut-flavored beer while doing the downward dog . ) Ilan Hall , a chef and the host of `` Knife Fight , '' describes his series as `` a bare-knuckled boxing show of a cooking competition '' that pits chefs against each other in an `` after-hours war zone . '' ( He wears a camouflage flak jacket instead of an apron . ) And sure enough , on this cooking show , eating well is an excuse to drink heavily . As a rowdy crowd cheers them on , rival chefs drink shots and fiercely whip up delicacies like braised goat ribs with yogurt and pomegranate . In one episode , John Herndon , who got his start as a flair bartender and still likes to set cocktails and dishes on fire , takes on Trevor Rocco . Mr. Rocco prepares by eating breakfast eggs . `` Got to coat your stomach for all the booze we are about to drink , '' he explains . In November , Esquire plans to introduce more shows , including `` Best Bars in America '' and `` White Collar Brawler , '' in which yuppie-esque lawyers , accountants and bankers are taught to box like real men . They may have to take a punch . They almost certainly will learn how to use a punch bowl .", "ref_summs": "The Esquire Network has a slate of lifestyle shows genteel enough to appeal to the probable target audience of moneyed metrosexuals .", "sys_summs": {"lede3": {"sys_summ": "On television nowadays , drinking is the password for anyone desperate for social approval .

{"src": "Though it may feel out of the way — far , far east on the Lower East Side — there 's no missing American Realness once you get there . In its seventh edition , this annual festival of contemporary performance announces itself boldly , its name projected in big block letters on the facade of Abrons Arts Center , home to most of the festival 's 18 boundary-blurring productions . It does n't take much to inject new life into an event sometimes at risk of stagnating , even as it champions the fresh , the unseen , the unexpected . At opening night on Thursday , visitors were guided from show to show through stairwells and hallways generally closed to the public . For anyone well acquainted with Abrons , as many Realness-goers are , this proved a simple , effective way to reinvent familiar spaces . Masterminded by Thomas Benjamin Snapp Pryor , Realness coincides with the citywide conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters — international curators and producers in the market for new work — which returns each year like a recurring dream , or nightmare , depending on your relationship to the idea of shopping for live art . Last year 's festival was full of work bemoaning the economic plight of performers ; this year 's first two productions struck out in less sullen directions , while still folding in some self-reflexive critique ( also available in the form of Realness swag declaring , `` I Suffer From Realness '' ) . First was `` Culture Administration & Trembling , '' a biodiverse collaboration among the performers Jennifer Lacey , Antonija Livingstone , Dominique Pétrin and Stephen Thompson . Ticket holders were instructed to remove their shoes , then led to the second floor of the arts complex , where a usually drab lobby had been transformed with geometric and botanical designs on the floor and walls . Ms. Lacey , Ms. Livingstone , Mr. Thompson and Dana Michel crawled languidly around the asymmetrical room , the audience huddled around the perimeter , to a soundscape of intermittent bird song . Ms. Pétrin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares . Three live snakes , delivered from offstage , soon joined in . Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another . This was just the first of many tenuously related , increasingly chaotic episodes , including the arrival of two Chihuahuas ( the snakes , not to worry , had exited ) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells . A mysterious voice , accompanying a video projection , pronounced , `` This piece will not save us . '' Ms. Lacey , cradling a small , three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs , told a story about an artist and an institution ( Realness , perhaps ) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers . What to do with all this information ? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife , of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance . Down one set of stairs and up another , in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances , the choreographer Heather Kravas , visiting from Seattle , offered the New York premiere of `` dead , disappears . '' Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark , self-punishing solo , as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra 's `` Verb List , '' a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces . What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism — walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases — deepened into a formidable exploration of language , the female body and the power play between them . Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair , as if it were a prisoner , Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole , shouting a list of alphabetized verbs , one per swipe . By the end , in whatever this struggle had been , she had secured the upper hand . American Realness continues through Jan. 17 .

{"src": "Most people , asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years , would likely think of militarization , calls for community policing , or perhaps the slow decline of `` broken windows '' . But from the turn of the millennium to date , arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called `` less-lethal '' electric control devices ( ECD ) , which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer : Taser International . The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States ' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies . The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues – a quirk of language known as a `` proprietary eponym '' . The word has even become a verb , as people commonly speak of being `` Tased '' or `` Tasered '' . The word Taser , though , did n't start with the company : it 's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle . Jack Cover , the inventor of the modern ECD , named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved , and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book . And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles , the innocence with which it 's told – a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth – belies a more sinister truth : the book itself is boldly racist . Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle , published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton , is typical of the literature of its time : an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent . In it , the protagonist , Tom Swift , develops an electric rifle – a totally novel idea in 1911 – and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory . Africa , in the context of the book , exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt . `` Elephant shooting in Africa ! My ! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow could n't do in the dark continent ! '' `` With the price of ivory soaring , '' says Swift 's veteran hunting companion , `` there 's a chance for us all to get a lot of money . '' While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age , today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson , Missouri , often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation . Like in the book , black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives , but as sites for plunder . Take , for example , the Department of Justice 's March report on the prevalence of predatory , revenue-based policing in St Louis County : entire municipalities there , as elsewhere in the US , float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents . This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown 's death . In the book , as in America today , the black people are rendered as either passive , simple and childlike , or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence . They are described in the book at various points as `` hideous in their savagery , wearing only the loin cloth , and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks '' , and as `` wild , savage and ferocious ... like little red apes '' . Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks , scarcely human , need to be controlled , guided or killed as determined by the more `` civilized '' white outsiders . Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown 's killing : an on-duty Ferguson police officer , a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of `` animals '' in reference to black protesters . Near and far , incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities , and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction . `` White police officers would n't be there if you were n't killing each other , '' former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November . Echoing Swift 's rank paternalism , he later added : `` I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city . '' In the book , when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons – particularly the electric rifle – to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede , they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors . `` Had it not been for the white men , the native village , which consisted of only frail huts , would have been completely wiped out by the animals , '' the novel reads . Being named after a racist book does n't make a company or device racist , any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so . A name is just that – and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are , simply for being named after our slaveholding first president . But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated , there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary , and aspirationally colorblind , institutions . Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that , every day , predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which `` civilized '' whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder , only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives . It is n't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse .", "ref_summs": "The newest tool in the law enforcement arsenal has an unseemly – and perhaps unsurprising – origin story", "sys_summs": {"lede3": {"sys_summ": "Most people , asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years , would likely think of militarization , calls for community policing , or perhaps the slow decline of `` broken windows `` .

{"src": "For the first time in Golden Globes history , not one of the traditional big four networks – NBC , CBS , ABC and FOX – received a nomination for best comedy or musical series . Even that reliable hoover-upper of awards , Modern Family , failed to make the list , with the nods going instead to the relatively young network addition The CW ( Jane the Virgin ) , HBO ( Silicon Valley , Girls ) and web-based shows ( Orange Is The New Black , Transparent ) . It tells us a lot about both the remarkable rise of the internet upstarts – Amazon , nominated with Transparent , only released their first original series in 2013 – and also the demise of the once-redoubtable network sitcom . And , given the quality of many of the fall additions – Mulaney , Bad Judge – it 's a situation that might not change any time soon.‬ The outstanding Showtime drama , which stars Ruth Wilson and Dominic West as the participants in the titular affair , both telling their side of the story as they saw it , has n't been a ratings smash , though figures have been rising as the first season progresses . The nods for Wilson , West and the big one , best drama series ( where it is the only debut season to compete ) are a vote of confidence for its sheer quality – it 's a grownup , sophisticated drama that deserves the love , much like Masters of Sex last time . This has n't been a solid show since its first season , and yet somehow it 's nominated for best drama series again , alongside the vastly superior Game of Thrones , The Good Wife , The Affair and House of Cards . Sorry about that , America . And while we 're at it : Ricky Gervais for Derek ? Sorry about that , too . There was much discussion around last year 's Emmys and a perceived Good Wife `` snub '' , when the truly brilliant fifth season failed to get a best drama series nod ( though Julianna Margulies did eventually walk away with a best actress award ) . At the Golden Globes , The Good Wife is emphatically included : best drama , best actress for Margulies and a much-deserved best supporting actor for Alan Cumming . Of course Christine Baranski should have been up for best supporting actress and Josh Charles best actor , but you ca n't win 'em all . For the fourth year in a row , TV 's most-watched show has been ignored by voters : 2010 remains the only year it was in the running for best drama series . That would n't have been an issue when the show was a shuffling , brainless mess , as it has been in previous seasons , but the most recent has been picking up critical plaudits as well as viewers ' eyeballs . Its absence leaves the Globes open to accusations of snobbery . This CW show , which tells the story of a religious young woman who is accidentally inseminated , pays homage to the telenovela format and comes off as original , heartfelt and surprisingly charming . It 's this year 's true underdog , picking up nominations for best comedy and best comedy actress for lead Gina Rodriguez . A quick glance at the full list of nominations shows just how A-list and Hollywood TV has become : Maggie Gyllenhaal , Clive Owen , Viola Davis , Kevin Spacey , Frances McDormand , Matthew McConaughey , Billy Bob Thornton , Mark Ruffalo , Woody Harrelson , Kathy Bates , Jon Voight and Bill Murray have all been either Academy Award winners or nominees . The small screen has gone huge . Masters of Sex , Brooklyn Nine-Nine , The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family all received multiple nominations last year , but were snubbed this time around . None did anything terribly wrong – Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Big Bang Theory are the same as they ever were , and Masters of Sex and Modern Family have arguably improved in the most recent series . Instead it seems like a clutch of newer , shinier , and more talked-about shows , such as The Affair and Transparent have captured voters ' imaginations .", "ref_summs": "Web series are ascending , The Good Wife is un-snubbed , The Walking Dead is snubbed and it ’ s excellent news for newcomers The Affair and Jane the Virgin", "sys_summs": {"lede3": {"sys_summ": "For the first time in Golden Globes history , not one of the traditional big four networks -- NBC , CBS , ABC and FOX -- received a nomination for best comedy or musical series .

That 's the bet entrepreneur Adam Bosworth , a veteran of Microsoft MSFT and Google GOOG , is making with Keas , an online service that aims to make exercising and eating your vegetables more fun — or at least a little less painful . San Francisco-based Keas ( pronounced kee-ahs , it is named for a bird found in New Zealand ) sells its web-based app to companies , which in turn push it out to their employees . Co-workers form teams of five or six and enter a competition in which members earn points by answering online quizzes about healthy foods , taking breaks at work to reduce stress , and meeting weekly goals for eating fruits and vegetables , sleeping , and , of course , exercising . All the activities are shared among participants on a Facebook-like news feed , where teammates and rivals can comment , give verbal pats on the back , or urge each other on . Keas charges $ 12 per user for a year and lets companies personalize the site and choose what rewards , if any , they give to winning teams . `` You can change people 's behavior a little , but you have to make it fun for them , '' says Bosworth , who previously ran Google Health , the search giant 's now defunct effort to create online medical records . `` People will fall off the wagon , and that 's when you need a social mechanism to help them climb back on .

At Progress Software PRGS , of some 600 employees who signed up , two-thirds reported losing some weight , one-third said they were less stressed , and scores said they pared down unhealthy foods . `` If you are engaged with others and you have a support mechanism , it is going to have a tremendous impact , '' says Joe Andrews , who heads human resources at Progress . But experts warn that while promising , health apps like Keas should be put in perspective . `` You can change behavior for a short time with just about anything , '' says Toni Yancey , professor of public health at UCLA . `` Where the pedal hits the metal is in getting people to change behavior for the long term .

WHY PEOPLE ARE ANGRY AT TED CRUZ ! ! ! How the government shutdown shook up the US economy Analysts say the hit to gross domestic product from lost government services alone totals $ 3.1 billion . what about that 8 trillion that went to 17 trillion in 5 years ? your not angry about that are you ? well you were when Nodumbo was running for his 1st term ... . Though Congress finally put an end to the 16-day government shutdown late Wednesday night , economists say the standoff has drained billions of dollars from the U.S. economy , with effects extending across a number of industries beyond the federal government itself . again ... that 17 trillion must mean nothing . Gon na blame that on Bush too ? like the democrats even said , a few billion is a drop in the bucket . so whats your beef , when we have a 17T , and someone actually tries to do something about it ? The shutdown forced hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors out of work , put government contracts on hold , shuttered national parks and museums and left businesses with fewer customers and lower sales . It 's too early to know the final cost of those and other effects , but analysts at IHS Global Insight said the hit to gross domestic product from lost government services alone totals $ 3.1 billion . no it put them on furlough , they still get paid for the time they did n't work . again , going to cry about 3 billion ? to pay back on the interest is close to a trillion alone , what about that ? There will also be some impact from lost private-sector jobs tied to the shutdown , as well as a loss of consumer and business confidence resulting from the debt-ceiling showdown , '' IHS economists wrote in an analysis released to the media . `` The exact impact on the rest of the economy will be hard to measure until delayed economic data are released . '' what do you think it will be when we can no longer raise our borrowing limit ? Even before that data becomes available , analysts at Standard & Poor 's estimated that the shutdown cost $ 24 billion ( or $ 1.5 billion a day ) and slowed the country 's economic growth rate by an annualized 0.6 percent for the current quarter . what have other failed programs , cost us ? post some of those . funny I do n't hear you call foul and point out that when Nodumbo and his band of thieves left Bush tax cuts in place for ( what was it 3 years ) , and then threw in employment and R & D incentives how it hit revenue in the belt ? well , you must have forgot how the R & D incentive had not only big business defense contractors , mostly pay in next to nothing and in some get money back from the tax payer huh ? There will also be some impact from lost private-sector jobs tied to the shutdown , as well as a loss of consumer and business confidence resulting from the debt-ceiling showdown , '' IHS economists wrote in an analysis released to the media . `` The exact impact on the rest of the economy will be hard to measure until delayed economic data are released .

Since our forecast did n't hold , we now have to lower our fourth-quarter growth estimate to closer to 2 percent . '' The Washington , D.C. region was hit especially hard . Some local businesses took a major blow since there were fewer tourists and workers shopping and dining out during the shutdown . Pete 's Diner on Capitol Hill , a favorite of many members of Congress including House Speaker John Boehner , lost about 80 percent of its usual business , according to MSN . Businesses like that diner , located in communities hit hard by the federal government shutdown , will never be able to make that money back . `` While the federal workers will receive their back pay , the missed coffee , burgers and cocktails will not be repurchased upon their return , '' Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank , said in a statement . since when did you care about small business ? an idiot can see the ACA is going to kill small business , and those that do n't fail will have to raise cost , costing the taxpayers plenty . where is your gripe about losss of revenue , because senate and congress get a 72 % insurance subsidy ? where again is your complaint with loopeholes for big business ? where is your complaint that the middle class is going to bear the burden with tax hikes , insurance premiums , and unfair payments , and return subsidy for paying in ? funny I work for a government contractor ... I still have a job , my insurance is going thru the roof after the 1st of the year , and my out of pocket along with it ... where is your complaint that with all this increase , it will put more middle class lower wage earners , on the taxpayer tab , because that loss hits them when it comes to food and paying for gas and electric ? They will have to apply for food and energy assistance ( the ones who were scraping by as it was ) because they can not afford to feed themselves or keep a light on . if you , and your ilk were not so ignorant to the obvious ( might be because you never worked a day in your life ) you would see what this is costing the middle class , and it has n't even gone into effect yet , because they cant get the program up and running due to outdated equipment ... where your complaint on that ? heck , millions of Americans cant log on to check whats out there ... I do n't hear you crying about the hundreds of millions , now going to be in the billions , because the whole thing will have to be scrapped and started over . go on ... let us hear foul on that ! But the shutdown 's impact was felt well beyond the nation 's capital . According to a new survey by International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs ( GS +0.23 % , news ) , about 40 percent of Americans say they had curbed spending as a result of the shutdown . The survey found that low-income consumers were especially likely to say the shutdown affected their behavior . Nearly half of those earning $ 35,000 or less said they scaled back their spending , versus about a third of respondents making $ 100,000 or more . well , shucks of course it will affect low income earners behavior ! their government benefits are at stake . they have to scale back on spending for reasons such as food share dropped a good chunk , as well as energy assistance . means they have more out of pocket costs .

{"src": "Despite the firestorm over his comments about rape and pregnancy , Representative Todd Akin says he has no plans to drop out as the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri . But what if he did ? The procedures in Missouri to change nominees midstream are complicated and intended to discourage just the sort of change that many in the Republican Party say they are eager to see happen . `` As more time passes , you 're starting to go up against deadlines , '' said Stacie Temple , a spokeswoman for Missouri 's secretary of state , Robin Carnahan , a Democrat . Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited , the more difficult it would get . The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening . His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder . Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17 , and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5 . Once the ballots are printed , any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots . That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin , but presumably the Republican Party — which badly wants him to withdraw — would cover the cost . Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22 . That might be the first firm deadline . But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25 , when general absentee ballots are sent out . Mel Carnahan , the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan 's father , died on Oct. 16 , 2000 , during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent , John Ashcroft . Mr. Carnahan 's name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November — and he won . ( His widow , Jean , was appointed to the seat , and lost it in special election in 2002 . ) Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders ( or simply concludes that he is n't able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign ) , Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race . State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine . Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot . Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill , the Democratic incumbent . Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin — now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy — stay in the race . In theory , the Democratic officials who run the state 's election offices could object to Mr. Akin 's request for a court order , a move that would force a hearing before a judge . The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw `` pursuant to a court order , which , except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto , shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate 's residence . '' Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state 's history . But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds . As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010 , she lost to Representative Roy Blunt , and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight . `` The secretary 's job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters , '' Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin 's name from the ballot . A further complication : Under state law , any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order , down to the county and city level , and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri . But Ms. Temple added that right now , it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw , not the secretary of state . `` It 's completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts , '' she said . Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out , the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days , or by Oct. 12 , whichever comes first .", "ref_summs": "In Missouri , changing nominees in the middle of a campaign is complicated .", "sys_summs": {"lede3": {"sys_summ": "Despite the firestorm over his comments about rape and pregnancy , Representative Todd Akin says he has no plans to drop out as the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri .

From an excerpt of New Money : Staying Rich that appeared on FOX Sports : Soon after the draft , she [ Buchanon 's mother ] told me that I owed her a million dollars for raising me for the past 18 years . Well , that was news to me . If my mother taught me anything , it 's that this is the most desperate demand that a parent can make on a child . The covenant of having a child is simply that you give your child everything possible , and they owe you nothing beyond a normal amount of love and respect . There is no financial arrangement .

Of this decision , he writes : `` I bought her a house with my luxury taste and no real wisdom behind it . It was an uneducated purchase . '' When the cost of this house became too big a burden , Buchanon offered to either buy his mother a smaller house or pay her $ 15,000 . She chose the money .

{"src": "The Coworking Resources Series is supported by join.me . Get your people together without actually getting them together . Just instantly share your screen so everybody 's on the same page . No need for a plane , a projector or a sandwich platter . Just gather at join.me . If you 've decided that it 's time to leave your bathrobe at home , let your favorite coffee shop have its corner table back , and join a coworking space , you 're only halfway there . Though coworking can have a lot of perks , how you take advantage of them and shape your experience is up to you . `` We 've had people who within the first week they 've kind of immersed themselves [ in ] to events and socializing with other people here , or they 're just here , they do their work , and then they take off , '' says Jeff Park , who manages the Ravenswood Coworking Group in Chicago . `` We know that they come in , but I think for them that 's enough for them . They just want to be around other people in a productive environment . '' Whether you 're aiming to be as productive as possible without a lot of socializing or trying to build a strong professional community that you can turn to for resources and support , these five tips can help you get the most out of your coworking experience . Green Spaces , a coworking space in Tribeca , specializes in environmentally focused businesses . Mountain View-based Cubes & Crayons combines childcare and coworking . WorkBar in Boston is hosted in a 2,500-square-foot space and has separate areas for cafe-like and quieter working styles . Coworking Brooklyn uses a small room that functions as an art gallery by night . The coworking experience varies drastically depending on which space you 're using . Different spaces have different levels of interaction with other workers , formality and general vibe . While some spaces , like Green Spaces and Cubes & Crayons , state their niche upfront , you 'll only be able to gauge what the environment is like by dropping in . Most spaces have daily drop-in rates . Try a couple of different spaces to see what works best for you before you commit . You can find a list of space around the world on the Coworking Wiki . `` See if the people in the space are people who you could go and see every day…if it 's not , then go to the next space , '' says Jay Catalan , the co-founder of a coworking space in Vancouver called The Network Hub . It 's less awkward to introduce yourself on the first day than to work alongside someone for months before asking their name . Even if you 're not usually outgoing , try to make a special effort for the first week or two when you start in a new coworking space . `` Just make introductions and it goes a long way…We 've had some people they wish they had met sooner because it turns out they did similar lines of work and just talking about it or actually sharing work , it 's not something you want to find out when you only have a couple more months left on your project or something , '' Park says . If you 're shy about meeting people , try getting creative ( like , for instance , bringing food ) . Bill Jacobson and Dave Ulrich , who co-founded WorkBar , said that one new coworker at WorkBar Boston showed up with a big box of doughnuts . `` He got to know everybody pretty quick , '' Jacobson says . Do n't stop interacting with your coworkers after you introduce yourself . One of the biggest benefits of coworking is the built-in community of professionals working across different industries . `` It may not seem directly 'productive ' to chat with your coworker for 10 minutes mid-day , but indirectly , it yields greater results than almost anything else you could spend time on , '' says Parker Whitney , office manager for Philadelphia coworking space Independents Hall , though he says , `` Invest in your community by taking ( not faking ) interest in what its members do , and it will take you with it…The people you 've always wanted to know are sitting all around you . Ask questions . Learn . Most importantly , help them when you can . '' If you are too busy during the workday for water cooler conversation , most coworking spaces host happy hours , seminars or other events that are prime opportunities for learning more about your coworkers . `` Even when you work for yourself , it 's important to realize your limitations , '' says Dave Martorana , a freelance Python & iPhone developer who works at Independents Hall . `` If you 're a software developer , you 're not necessarily a designer , product manager , or marketer as well . When you work at a coworking space , people with those skills probably work right next to you and are just as interested in building something awesome as you are . '' While coworking one day , I ended up testing someone 's website , getting caught in the crossfire of a music choice showdown , and participating in a raised-hand vote about which suit jacket a fellow coworker should wear to a meeting . Needless to say , the social aspects of coworking — despite their advantages — can be extremely distracting . Which is why out of the 37 productivity tips that I collected for a previous article , this one from Paul Preibisch of B3D Multitech remains my favorite : `` Rather than standing up from behind your wall of monitors and shouting , 'Can you all shut up ? ! ' you may want to consider , what I call 'The Cone of Silence . ' It really works ! All you need are a nice pair of headphones , ( not earbuds ) , a wave file that plays 'white noise , ' and Windows Media Player set to auto-repeat .

No need for a plane , a projector or a sandwich platter . Just gather at join.me . So what exactly is join.me ? It 's an impromptu meeting space that happens wherever , whenever .

{"src": "Tim Burrack , a northern Iowa farmer in his 44th growing season , has taken to keeping a wary eye out for unfamiliar vehicles around his 300 acres of genetically modified corn seeds . Along with other farmers in this vast agricultural region , he has upped his vigilance ever since Mo Hailong and six other Chinese nationals were accused by U.S. authorities in 2013 of digging up seeds from Iowa farms and planning to send them back to China . The case , in which Mo pleaded guilty in January , has laid bare the value—and vulnerability—of advanced food technology in a world with 7 billion mouths to feed , 1.36 billion of them Chinese . Citing that case and others as evidence of a growing economic and national security threat to America 's farm sector , U.S. law enforcement officials are urging agriculture executives and security officers to increase their vigilance and report any suspicious activity . But on a March 30 visit to Iowa , Justice Department officials could offer little advice to ensure against similar thefts , underlining how agricultural technology lying in open fields can be more vulnerable than a computer network or a factory floor . `` It may range down to traditional barriers like a fence and doing human patrols to making sure you get good visuals on what 's occurring , '' Assistant Attorney General John Carlin , head of the Justice Department 's national security division , said when touring Iowa State University . But agriculture sector executives say fences and guards are not feasible , due to the high cost and impracticality of guarding hundreds of thousands of acres . Tom McBride , intellectual property attorney at Monsanto—one of the firms whose seeds were targeted by Mo—said it safeguards its genetically modified organism ( GMO ) technology by protecting its computers , patenting seeds and keeping fields like Burrack 's unmarked . Monsanto mon says it is not considering physical barriers like fences or guards . The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department say cases of espionage in the agriculture sector have been growing since Mo was first discovered digging in an Iowan field in May 2011 . Over the past two years , U.S. companies , government research facilities and universities have all been targeted , according to the FBI . Although prosecutors were unable to establish a Chinese government link to Mo 's group , the case adds to U.S.-China frictions over what Washington says is increasing economic espionage and trade secret theft by Beijing and its proxies . A U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters the agency looked for a connection between the Chinese government and the conspiracy carried out by Mo . `` In cases like this , we can see connections , but proving to the threshold needed in court requires that we have documents that the government has directed this , '' the official said . `` It 's almost impossible to get . '' A Chinese embassy spokesman in Washington , Zhu Haiquan , said he did not have detailed information on the Mo case but that China `` stands firm '' on the protection of intellectual property and maintains `` constant communication and cooperation '' with the U.S. government on the issue . On his visit to Washington last September , President Xi Jinping reiterated China 's denial of any government role in the hacking of U.S. corporate secrets . Mo , an employee of Chinese firm Kings Nower Seed , pleaded guilty to stealing seed grown by U.S. firms Monsanto , Dupont Pioneer dd and LG Seeds . Prosecutors say he specifically targeted fields that grow the parent seeds needed to replicate GMO corn . The FBI says it suspects he was given the location by workers for the seed companies , but did not charge any employees . DuPont Pioneer and LG Seeds declined to comment for this story . Mo , whose case was prosecuted by the Justice Department as a national security matter rather than a simple criminal case , now faces a sentence of up to five years in prison . Five others charged in the case are still wanted by the FBI and are believed to have fled to China or Argentina . Charges were dropped against a sixth Chinese suspect . The number of international economic espionage cases referred to the FBI is rising , up 15 % each year between 2009 and 2014 and up 53 % in 2015 . The majority of cases reported involve Chinese nationals , the U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters . In the agriculture sector , organic insecticide , irrigation equipment and rice , along with corn , are all suspected to have been targeted , including by Chinese nationals , the official said . Mo Hongjian , vice president of Kings Nower Seed 's parent company , Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group , declined to comment on the case or on the company 's connection with the Chinese government . The parent firm is privately owned , but says it receives government money for research in `` science and technology . '' China bans commercial growing of GMO grains due to public opposition to the technology and imports of GMO corn have to be approved by the agriculture ministry . Still , President Xi called in 2014 for China to innovate and dominate the technique , which promises high yields through resistance to drought , pests and disease . In January , a Greenpeace report found some Chinese farmers are illegally growing GMO corn whose strains belong to companies including Monsanto , Syngenta syt and DuPont Pioneer . Monsanto , which supplies Burrack 's seed , said it can block foreign groups who request to tour their lab and learning center in Huxley , Iowa . For the past few years , Monsanto says it has run its own background checks on Chinese delegations that ask for a tour , and , if they are approved , boosts security to be sure they do not steal anything or take pictures . In Washington , U.S. senators have called for a review of the $ 43 billion deal by state-owned ChemChina to buy Swiss seed group Syngenta , which generates nearly a quarter of its revenue from North America . Acquiring GMO seed and successfully recreating a corn plant would allow Chinese companies to skip over roughly eight years of research and $ 1.5 billion spent annually by Monsanto to develop the corn , the company says . Burrack 's farm itself was not targeted by Mo , though he grows the Monsanto parent seed that the Chinese national was digging for . Burrack grows the corn in two fields in front of and behind his house where he can watch them , a small part of his 2,800-acre farm . He said he is told by Monsanto where and when to plant the parent seed , but has never been told to keep what he is planting a secret . `` What no one seems to understand is that they 're stealing from people like me , '' Burrack said . `` They 're stealing the research that farmers pay for when they buy Monsanto seed .

{"src": "If 2014 was the year of the selfie , then 2015 took the art of self-photography to a new and dangerous level . People are , quite literally , dying to take a picture of themselves . In Russia this year there have been a handful of selfie-related fatalities , including the death of two men in the Ural Mountains who posed for a photo while pulling the pin from a hand grenade . And , in June , a university graduate died after trying to take a selfie while hanging from a Moscow bridge . Most recently a 17-year-old boy fell to his death from a rooftop as he tried to take his picture for his Instagram page . He had previously taken a number of similar pictures of himself posing on high rooftops in the city of Vologda . The problem is n't just limited to Russia . In the US recently a man died after shooting himself in the neck while taking a selfie . At least 12 people have died this year while taking pictures of themselves making the practice more deadly than shark attacks , of which there have only been eight recorded deaths in 2015 , according to tech news site Mashable . The statistic is creating very real problems for governments . In August , officials at the Waterton Canyon in Colorado were forced to close the park after several people were caught getting a little too close to the wildlife . `` We 've actually seen people using selfie sticks to try and get as close to the bears as possible , sometimes within 10 feet [ 3 metres ] , '' said recreation manager Brandon Ransom in a blog . And , at Yellowstone National Park , officials issued a warning after five separate incidents of selfie-takers being gored by bison . In Australia , a rock that looks like a wedding cake was fenced off because too many people were climbing it to take pre or post-wedding photos of themselves . While in Russia , in response to the number of deaths there , the Interior Ministry launched a campaign warning that `` self-photography could cost you your life '' . `` A selfie with a weapon kills , '' the brochure read . The accompanying poster campaign listed dangerous places to take a selfie . So why are some people willing to risk their life to take the ultimate selfie ? It may come down to pure bravado , thinks Lee Thompson - whose snap of himself on top of the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janiero went viral in June 2014 . `` People see pictures like mine and see how they spread across the world and see a way to make themselves famous for 15 minutes , '' he told the BBC . A professional photographer , Mr Thompson admits that the picture he took was done as a publicity stunt for his travel company , Flash Pack . He did , however , get permission to climb the statue . `` I 'm not a serial selfie-taker - this shot was to publicise my business . It was the shot I knew I had to get because people love selfies , '' he told the BBC . He admits that the trend towards ever more dangerous selfies is `` getting out of control '' . `` Be creative with your pictures but do n't put yourself in danger , '' he advised . According to research published by the Ohio State University , the pictures that people post on social media can tell an interesting story about their personality . Hundreds of tests on people 's social media habits were conducted for the study , which showed that people who post a lot of selfies also tend to score higher in traits of narcissism and psychopathy . Lead researcher Jesse Fox said that , for many , a dangerous selfie is worth it for the number of likes and comments it will generate . `` Likes are a quantifiable way of measuring popularity and these days it is n't enough to just post a picture of yourself , because everyone is doing that . The more extreme it is , the more likely you are to stand out and get lots of likes and comments . '' The rise of the selfie as an art form has not gone unnoticed by manufacturers such as Asus , which recently launched a phone dubbed the ZenFone Selfie , that as the name suggests , comes with a powerful camera . But it too is sensitive to the issue of risk-taking selfies and its marketing of the device in France came with a poster campaign similar to that of the Russian government , pointing out places where taking a selfie would be ill-advised - including in front of trains , in cars and with bears . Despite the publicity , there does n't appear to be any let-up in the amount of death-defying selfies being taken , nor people 's appetite to look at them . A video on YouTube , compiling what it describes as the `` 25 most dangerous selfies ever '' , has been viewed over 20 million times . It includes examples of a man taking a selfie while a bull charges at him , a man posing with a lion , someone taking a picture in front of a train and a woman taking a selfie of herself and her toddler while driving . James Kingston 's picture of himself hanging off a crane ( above ) came in at number three . The list also features several self-portraits with sharks which had gone viral but which the video exposes as fakes . Selfies may have become more dangerous than shark attacks but it seems that even the most intrepid self-shooter draws the line at a picture with a Great White .", "ref_summs": "The selfie craze has been taken to a new , more worrying , level as deaths from self-portraiture overtake shark attacks in 2015 .", "sys_summs": {"lede3": {"sys_summ": "If 2014 was the year of the selfie , then 2015 took the art of self - photography to a new and dangerous level .

If there 's a soft spot in your heart for the sword- & -sandal epic - and from the star rating above , I think you can guess where I stand - then you 'll swoon with giddy delight over `` Gladiator , '' a sweaty , stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of `` Ben-Hur , '' `` Spartacus '' and the so recently departed Steve Reeves . From his biceps to his gluteus , Maximus is maximus . This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator has n't a shred of humor , but then , he does n't have time for idle nonsense when he 's lopping off heads all day . ( The head-lopping is apparently his signature , like the mark of Zorro . ) In director Ridley Scott 's thrilling , burnished epic , Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius ( Richard Harris ) tosses him a promotion he does n't want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape . All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs . The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus . Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for `` The Insider , '' he 's no gym-toned pretty boy . He 's solid , beefy , rough-hewn , creaking along in his heavy leather costume , with a look on his puss of weary disdain . What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty : `` What we do in life echoes in eternity ! '' Anyway , it ca n't be his hygiene , although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow . After a coup by the emperor 's weak-kneed son , Commodus ( a whiny , surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix ) , Maximus ' fortunes change . He winds up being thrown to the tigers , two shows daily , in Rome 's Colosseum , the entertainment complex of its day . Crowe , like his character , must grimly come to terms with the fact that , actor or gladiator , it 's all about showmanship . Give the crowd what it wants , either at the multiplex or in the arena , and you can write your own ticket . `` I have power only to amuse the mob , '' he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater . The plot , about avenging honor , provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register ; they 're subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage , with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood . For fans of the genre , yes , this is a good thing . Connie Nielsen plays Commodus ' sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched ( politics , you know ) . Nielsen 's costumes are laced up like bondage gear , and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past . But the camera only has eyes for Crowe . The glowering ! The seething ! The hooded gaze ! The quiet suffering ! ( Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for . No anesthetic ! No disinfectant ! ) The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries , all of them thinkers , including Derek Jacobi ( `` I , Claudius '' ) as a senator , Djimon Hounsou ( `` Amistad '' ) as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed , who died with two days to go on the shoot , looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur .

{"src": "Nevertheless , the incident exposes a horrible problem for the Government . It has forced large cuts on councils , but has done nothing to ensure they cut the right things – extravagant salaries , junkets and pointless bureaucracy – while protecting the services taxpayers value . Indeed , there is much evidence that the opposite is happening . It 's not just this week 's headlines about the cutting of public lavatories in Manchester and regeneration programmes in Liverpool : the problem is universal . In south Gloucestershire , Miss Vincent could have set Mumsnet on the council over the £185,590 salary of its chief executive , Amanda Deeks , or its new £31 million office in Yate . But it was Cameron 's jugular she went for . In many people 's minds , these are already the `` Coalition cuts '' , so there is probably no need for councils to wage a propaganda war . But the London borough of Newham has launched one none the less . Besides spitting vitriol in its in-house magazine ( £547,000 a year to produce ) , the borough 's £81,000-a-year elected mayor ( who rules in tandem with a £241,000-a-year chief executive ) has made a video moaning about the unfairness and holding forth about the council 's great achievements – omitting , for some reason , to mention the £111 million spent on its vastly luxurious new waterside HQ . It is the same all over Britain : old people and disabled children are getting it in the neck while council flunkeys carry on living the high life . Renfrewshire is closing community halls , but spent £15,000 hiring an X Factor singer to switch on its Christmas lights . While chopping transport for special-needs children , Cambridgeshire has splurged £181 million on a guided busway that has yet to carry a passenger , two years after it was due to open . Barnet is thinking of doing away with school-crossing patrols – but last year increased its leader 's allowance by 55 per cent . In other words , in preaching localism , the Government has made a similar miscalculation to Mrs Thatcher 's over the poll tax . It was supposed to increase local accountability : if residents received high bills , they would vote their councils out of office . Instead , the populace took it out on the Government . Earlier , Mrs Thatcher had taken a different approach , intervening directly over council overspending by capping the rates . She positioned herself , in effect , as the defender of the people against town hall extravagance . Mr Cameron needs to do something similar : rather than talk about localism , he needs to lay down the law and stop front-line services being cut . It turns out that even the £800 million he pledged for carers of disabled children is not ring-fenced : it could end up kitting out a councillor 's office with plasma screens , and the Government could n't do a thing . So rather than moaning about councils ' behaviour , why not a slip a clause into the Localism Bill that gives the Government powers to cap salaries at the same level as a Cabinet minister ( currently £134,565 ) ? It would hardly be a vote-loser , even if it does n't fit in with the theme of devolving power . Town hall chiefs may be earning more than Mr Cameron , but that is no reason to fall at their feet . On the contrary : their inflated salaries show where the worst waste and extravagance really lie .

U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg wrote in his decision that the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe failed to show `` it will suffer injury that would be prevented by any injunction the Court could issue . '' A federal judge 's decision Friday could fuel heightened tensions in the battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline . The ruling on a Native American tribe 's request for a temporary restraining order on construction comes one day after Gov . Jack Dalrymple activated the state National Guard `` in the event they are needed to support law enforcement response efforts , '' according to a National Guard spokesman . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed an emergency motion Sunday asking the court `` to prevent further destruction of the tribe 's sacred sites by Dakota Access Pipeline . '' , which would span four states , has led to heated , sometimes violent protests . Proponents say the project could be an economic boon for the region and potentially change the landscape of the US crude oil supply . Those seeking to halt construction warn of an environmental disaster that would destroy sacred Native American sites . , has predicted the project would help the United States become less dependent on importing oil from unstable regions of the world . The tribe wants to halt further construction on an area two miles west of North Dakota Highway 1806 , near Lake Oahe , until the judge 's ruling . The plaintiffs claim the tribe was not properly consulted before the US Army Corps of Engineers approved the pipeline project , which would run from North Dakota to South Dakota , Iowa and Illinois . A US district court judge is expected to make a decision by Friday . The Army Corps of Engineers has declined to comment , citing the pending litigation . On Thursday , a state National Guard statement said the governor had asked it `` to support law enforcement and augment public safety efforts , in light of recent activity with the Dakota Access Pipeline protest . '' `` The Guard members will serve in administrative capacities and assist in providing security at traffic information points , '' the statement said . `` The Guardsmen will not be going to the actual protest site . The governor also placed additional Guardsmen on standby alert in the event they are needed to support law enforcement response efforts . '' Thousands of people from more than 200 Native American tribes have supported the Standing Rock Sioux 's efforts to protect their lands , waters and sacred sites during construction of the pipeline , according to the tribe . If completed , the 1,172-mile pipeline would carry 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day from North Dakota to Illinois . Energy Transfer said the pipeline would bring an estimated $ 156 million in sales and income taxes to state and local governments . It would also add 8,000 to 12,000 construction jobs , the developer said . But about 30 environmental groups , including the Sierra Club and Greenpeace , have , calling it `` yet another example of an oil pipeline project being permitted without public engagement or sufficient environmental review . '' ' Protesters are also worried that digging the pipeline under the Missouri River could affect the drinking water supply if the pipeline breaks . Protests turned violent over the weekend , with some demonstrators breaking down a wire fence and trespassing onto a construction area , the Morton County Sheriff 's Department said . `` Protesters physically assaulted private security officers hired by Dakota Access Pipeline . The security officers were hit and jabbed with fence posts and flagpoles , '' the sheriff 's department said . `` According to several reports from security officers , knives were pulled on them or they witnessed protestors with large knives . '' The sheriff 's department also said two guard dogs were injured . But protesters disputed that account , said .

The North Shore has become a world-renowned kite-surfing destination , especially around Cabarete , where there are several schools . It 's fun even if you just watch . Getting there : Samana is two to three hours from Puerto Plata or the main airport in Santo Domingo . By Larry Olmsted Special for , USA TODAY has long been a favorite of U.S. and international buyers , thanks to plentiful beaches and high-quality golf courses , high-end developments coupled with affordable prices , and a stable , democratic government . Forty years ago , the nation 's first developed tourism area was around Puerto Plata and Cabarete on the northern coast . But for the past two decades , the north has been largely overshadowed by the southeast , especially La Romana and the heavily developed Punta Cana peninsula . Now , thanks to infrastructure improvements and the simple desire to find the next hot place , second-home buyers are heading back north , spurred by the development of the Samaná Peninsula . A new highway , part of a huge ongoing government infrastructure investment , links Samaná with the capital , Santo Domingo , and has dramatically reduced travel time from more than five hours to under 2½ . The newly emerging Samaná Peninsula began as a second-home destination for Dominicans but is increasingly being `` discovered '' by overseas buyers . `` On the south of the peninsula , the biggest city is Samaná , which has the cruise dock and several new developments , the largest of which is Puerto Bahia , attracting more Dominican buyers , '' says Pedro Purcell , a broker with Dominican Properties in Santo Domingo . `` The two highest-profile developments are on the north , Balcones del Atlántico and El Portillo . There are more American buyers in the north , as well as French , Germans and Italians . `` Unlike Punta Cana , Samaná is mostly condos , not the big villas and estate homes , and it is not as expensive as Cap Cana or Casa de Campo to the south , where people look for celebrities , '' Purcell adds . `` Here , they look for the beach lifestyle , and while the projects are high-quality , they are not nearly as large as in the Punta Cana area . '' A look at three North Shore neighborhoods • Puerto Plata . The Dominican Republic 's first major tourism enclave , this beach town has a lot of hotel and restaurant development , but with few second homes besides Seahorse Ranch , which was built in the 1980s . The gated 250-acre equestrian and beach community has more than 100 private homes ranging from $ 500,000 to $ 8 million . The Victoria Hotel within the Playa Dorado golf resort here plans to begin offering a fractional ownership club this year . • Cabarete . Less developed than Puerto Plata , beach-centric Cabarete has until recently attracted mainly European buyers . That is about to change with the transformation of the Playa Grande golf course — known as `` the Pebble Beach of the Caribbean '' — into a high-end residential community . It will include an equestrian center , clubhouse and recreational facilities , with villas and estate houses on sale later this year . Luxury Asian developer Aman is also planning a private enclave of residential villas here . • Samana Peninsula . Several towns on this 40-mile-long peninsula are seeing development , but for U.S. buyers , the runaway favorite is Las Terrenas . Already home to several boutique hotels , the longtime fishing village is emerging as a culinary hotspot , with European chefs taking advantage of the seafood . A 66-acre former coconut plantation , Las Terrenas ' Balcones del Atlantico will have 350 residences , from apartments to beach villas , from $ 475,000 to $ 1.7 million .

{"src": "The tech giant was forced to discontinue the model after worldwide reports of exploding phones SAUMSUNG has announced it will scrap its Galaxy Note 7 model after worldwide reports of exploding phones , as thousands of frustrated owners wonder if they are entitled to a refund . Earlier today the company took the extraordinary step of asking owners of the £750 handset to immediately turn their phone off because of fears the device may catch fire . Customers have been left in the lurch by Samsung , who have so far declined to give details on whether they will be refunding customers . But consumer experts Which have reassured Galaxy 7 owners they will be covered as Samsung has admitted the fault . The South Korean tech giant had already said it would halt in sales and production of the model while it investigated reports of phones exploding . And a Samsung spokeswoman this morning confirmed the company `` has permanently discontinued the production of Galaxy Note 7″ , hours after billions of dollars were wiped off the tech firm 's stock market value . For customers who have already shelled out hundreds of pounds on the device , worries will be less about Samsung 's share price and more about their consumer rights . Last month the tech firm announced an `` exchange programme '' for customers in the UK and Ireland who had already purchased the phone , after reports of the device 's lithium-ion battery catching fire . Offering the replacement handsets , Samsung said it was `` fully confident the battery issue had been fully resolved '' . But there continued to be reports worldwide of exploding phones , terrifying owners . In the company 's home country , South Korea , a Burger King diner had their meal interrupted when their replacement Galaxy Note 7 burst into flames in dramatic scenes later uploaded to YouTube . Airlines have also been warning travellers to switch off their phones while flying . Hopes of a straightforward product recall for UK consumers appeared to be dashed after Royal Mail and ParcelForce refused to ship the device , even if they are being returned to Samsung . Samsung 's spokeswoman this morning was unable to confirm what plans were in place for reimbursing customers affected by the exploding phone debacle . But according to consumer rights experts at Which.co.uk , customers who bought the Galaxy Note 7 should be entitled to a refund , because Samsung has recognised an issue with the model . Those who have pre-ordered the handset from a UK retailer are able to cancel the order and get a refund at any time up to 14 days after the phone is delivered . In a statement this morning , Samsung advised Galaxy Note 7 owners to `` power down and stop using the device and take advantage of the remedies available '' . Any owners concerned about their phone should phone Samsung on 0330 726 7864 . We pay for your stories ! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team ?

You have to fire up the Wayback Machine to better understand how 'ino helped change how this city eats . Fifteen years ago , New York was a bistro town . There was the old guard : Blue Ribbon , Le Gamin , Jules , Lucky Strike , Raoul 's and a dozen others . Then in 1997 , a newcomer opened in SoHo named Balthazar , which raised the stakes with its set direction and unlisted reservation line . Balthazar was white-hot : it had perfectly distressed mirrors , fresh and crusty bread , and although it was impossible to get a table unless you knew somebody who knew somebody , you could always go at midnight and eat at the bar . Soon , New York was lousy with bistros . It was a good era if you wanted a kir , steak frites , escargot , frisée lardon , profiteroles . Authenticity , or some version of it , was the point . Everybody was pressing butter into little ramekins to be served at room temperature , changing the paper covering the tablecloths before serving dessert . Honestly , it was really fun . The restaurants were lively , intimate , sexy . So what if you could recite the menu before you set foot in the door ? But if you were a young chef with a measure of vision and creativity , you were stuck either making onion soup and beet salad with goat cheese . Or you worked on the line executing the vision and creativity of an older chef in Midtown or TriBeCa . Prune had n't yet opened . Neither had Diner . Brooklyn did n't have much of a food scene outside the restaurant row on Smith Street , which was anchored by Patois , a bistro . If you went to Williamsburg , it was to go to a party or to go dancing , not to eat . This was the landscape when Jason and Jennifer Denton opened 'ino on a quiet street in the West Village . The kitchen in the back was the size of a D.J . booth and used the technology of induction burners , which was novel at the time : it was a paninoteca that looked as if it belonged in New York rather than being shipped , tile by mirrored tile , from Milan . The culinary vocabulary was Italian , but it was n't sepia-toned and sentimental . Instead , there was a focus on ingredients at a time when , in New York at least , few people cared . It had simple food done well , and sometimes you encountered flavors that were n't lifted out of the songbook . I still have a 13-year-old memory of sharing a shredded duck sandwich with sweet relish , a combination that is about as authentically Italian as a functioning parliament . You could go to 'ino to get something familiar ( prosciutto and cheese will never get old ) , but you could also try something new . 'Ino was a casual joint with integrity , an easygoing place where you could eat well as long as you did n't mind the wait . Today , we take this combination for granted , and expect all kitchens to put some effort into sourcing and display a little creativity no matter how limited the resources .

Richmond Police have already arrested the 18 year old Larry Pratcher of Richmond in the slaying of De Teen guilty of murdering De La Salle star 2006-10-11 14:17:00 PDT MARTINEZ -- A Contra Costa County jury today found 17-year-old Darren Pratcher guilty of first-degree murder in the 2004 slaying of former De La Salle High School football star Terrance Kelly on a Richmond street . The jury came to the decision after deliberating for more than a week in a trial that began Aug. 23 . As the verdict was read this afternoon , Pratcher put both hands over eyes , cast his head down and shook it from side to side . His brother , Larry Pratcher Jr. , was ejected from the court room after issuing a string of obscenities . Kelly 's family nodded and clapped , and the victim 's father , Landrin Kelly , hugged his wife . Muriel Pratcher , Pratcher 's mother , cried when the verdict was announced , saying , `` Oh my God . '' `` It was a no-win situation , '' Bernice Moore , Pratcher 's grandmother , said outside the courtroom . `` I lost my grandson to prison , Mr. Kelly lost his son forever . We both lost . It 's just a tragedy . '' During the trial , Pratcher 's own attorney admitted that the young man fired the four rifle shots that killed Kelly on Aug. 12 , 2004 -- two days before the football player was scheduled to move to the University of Oregon on a sports scholarship . But defense attorney Jonathan Laba argued that Pratcher killed Kelly in a case of mistaken identity . He said that the defendant feared for his life in an unrelated dispute and accidentally shot Kelly as the football player was waiting in a car to give his stepbrother , Brandon Young , a ride home from his girlfriend 's house in Richmond 's Iron Triangle District . Laba argued that Pratcher should be convicted of manslaughter because the death was `` a tragic mistake . '' But prosecutor David Brown told jurors Kelly 's death amounted to `` cold-blooded murder , '' because Pratcher was determined to kill someone that night . Brown argued that Pratcher had the opportunity to notice that Kelly was in the car before grabbing the rifle , advancing on the Oldsmobile and opening fire . `` It 's totally unfair for them to say it was premeditated , '' said Pratcher 's father , Larry Sr. `` Terrance just came right up ; it 's impossible for it to be premeditated . It 's totally unfair -- my son is not guilty of first degree murder . '' Pratcher was 15 years old when Kelly was killed and was tried as an adult in Contra Costa County Superior Court . He faces and faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life . Kelly died two days before he was to leave for the University of Oregon , where he had a football scholarship and was expected top play safety . His death stunned his hometown of Richmond as well as students , former players and fans at De La Salle in Concord . Kelly had been named the most valuable player the previous season at De La Salle , where he played linebacker and running back on a team that did n't lose a game in his four years there . Police arrested Pratcher , whose older brother , Larry Jr. , had played youth basketball with Kelly , five days after the killing . Several witnesses placed Pratcher at the crime scene with the rifle , and at least two told investigators they saw him fire into Kelly 's car . Brown offered no motive for the crime but said Pratcher told a friend : `` I had to do what I had to do .

{"src": "By DEXTER FORDMAY 9 , 2014 MALIBU , CALIF. — Good luck , America , with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8 . The car is a post-petroleum brand statement . It 's a sci-fi showpiece . It 's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car . It 's a triumph of parts-bin engineering . It 's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer . It 's a winged chariot of the Malibu über-chic . It 's a $ 136,625 ( destination included ! ) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls . The hardware , at least , is straightforward . The central passenger shell is a stiff , lightweight carbon-fiber structure . It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine . An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front , its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels . The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini ; its 3-cylinder , twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission . The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel . Other extreme weight-saving measures , including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass , keep the weight to 3,267 pounds . The long , light doors swing up and forward . From the front , with doors open , the i8 looks as if it 's signaling a touchdown . The interior is compact yet comfortable , though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom , and the rear seats are designed for tiny , limber people . Getting in is a challenge . The sill is wide , the seat is low , and there 's a trick : sit sideways , slide butt in , retract legs . Getting out ? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands . Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons . `` Comfort '' keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h. , or until you mash the right-side pedal . The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h . or until the battery fades . Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V . mode , and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120 . The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings . I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g . ( impatient cornering ) to 37 m.p.g . ( safe-and-sane commuting ) . In the city , the i8 feels silent , solid and intuitive — the excitement happens outside , as gawkers track its progress . On Los Angeles 's well-used freeways , the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired . Even with the variable dampers at full soft , the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds . High-performance tires come standard in the United States ; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride . In Sport mode , the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars , pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners . It sounds great , and it should : much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system . The i8 feels strong at full power , but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent . The i8 takes time to gather itself , with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag . On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon . The brakes are strong , the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault , and there 's enough power to reach the next corner presently . BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds , and top speed is 155 m.p.h . The front tires push when going hard into corners , but everything sticks coming out . Even with the stability control off , the i8 resists spinning its tires — the software ghost is still there , lurking in the machine . The i8 is complicated and imperfect . A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out . It rides harshly . The exterior design is too clever — the layered rear deck whispers `` Your trunk is open . '' Still , if the i8 represents the future of sports cars , things are looking bright .

Says Lou , `` Professional sports in China have a great future for fans and entrepreneurs . '' China 's sports landscape has changed greatly since Lou , 36 , first became interested . He started playing basketball when he was a soldier with time to kill and recalls limited chances to watch sports . By contrast , he says , young and old alike these days can tune into sports 24-7 in China on cable TV and on the Internet . These viewers see unprecedented gains by Chinese in world sports . China 's hosting of the Summer Olympics , its first-place finish in winning gold medals and government support for the development of a sports industry have fueled a raft of commercial investments and marketing breakthroughs . The Lou family 's Guangsha Group , a construction group controlled by his father , Lou Zhongfu , who is worth $ 650 million and ranks No . 146 on this year 's China Rich List , began its support of sports in the 1990s by sponsoring soccer exhibitions . The company 's biggest move was into basketball in April 2005 , when it hooked up with the CBA . Lou himself hired the first coach and attends the team 's home games . In 2009 the Lions were 28 -- 22 in the CBA , an improvement from its .500 record last year and its miserable .200 in 2006 . `` Like our league , we have been making progress over time , '' Lou says . The total TV audience for CBA games in the past season increased to 600 million viewers , from 350 million a year earlier . Guangsha 's franchise , however , remains a tiny part of the group 's overall worth . Lou says there 's no exaggerating the influence of Yao Ming on the development of the sports business in China . `` People skipped work to watch Yao 's Houston Rockets when they made the second round of the playoffs this year even though Yao was hurt and did n't play . In the past the public stayed up like that only for the World Cup , '' he explains . The way Lou sees it , Yao has succeeded because he 's a classic example of Chinese-overseas cooperation : If he did n't have success and a lot of fans at home in the first place , he could n't have gone overseas . And if he had n't made it in the NBA , he could n't have become popular worldwide . `` China today is too short of these kind of superstars , '' Lou says . The Chinese Basketball Association and sports in general in China need more participation by entrepreneurs like Yao . `` Without full ownership there is n't enough commitment to field good players , '' Lou says . `` For Guangsha , every penny we spend is our own money . Better management will lead to better teams . '' Lou thinks more Chinese will invest in sports teams abroad , just as two Chinese recently invested in the National Basketball Association 's Cleveland Cavaliers . `` We would be very interested in investing in the NBA if an opportunity presented itself , '' he says .

We all have different stories about the moment we took control of our lives . But what we share is this : by signing on a dotted line to incomprehensible terms , we risked everything . We chose education , no matter the cost . In some cases , we alienated ourselves from our families and communities . By spending money we did n't have to attend schools we could n't afford , we joined an elite class we 'd never truly fit into . We are , in a way , without community . As a result of pursuing higher education , I am highly educated and deeply in debt . If you do n't have a similar story of adversity – and you 're not in debt – you 're probably not my friend . I grew up in a working-class neighborhood outside Cleveland , Ohio , where I was taught that if only I followed the rules , I could succeed . I was so good a student that a guidance counselor suggested Antioch College , a prestigious yet expensive liberal arts school . My mom made it her mission that I attend .

For the poor and working-class student who finds themselves let into a wealthy institution , every part of being there can be an education that helps level the field . At the same time , I felt markedly different than my peers in ways I could n't articulate . Before I came to Antioch – where it seemed like half the campus was either vegetarian or vegan – I 'd never met anyone who offered political reasons to refuse food . By the end of my first year , I knew better than to think that people got ahead just by following the rules . My elite peers had something I did n't , something I might never have , something that was no result of hard work . In high school I 'd worked minimum wage jobs just so I could afford to dress like everyone else , scouring discount stores for deals on the latest fashions . At Antioch , people wore `` thrift store finds '' and lived in intentional squalor , swearing off hygienic and other consumer products that I did n't have the money to buy . I was bitter , envious . I felt entitled to what they had – no more , but no less . I was tired of working two or three jobs at a time while going to school and still not having enough . When my second year of college came and the scholarships stopped , I started working as a stripper . As a sex worker I was rolling in cash , but still lacking in financial literacy . Poor people make choices that wealthier people would n't . We are in debt for reasons those who are n't ca n't comprehend . Rather than explain myself , I gravitate toward those with similar experiences . After college , I lost my job as a public school teacher when it was revealed that I had worked in the sex industry . The fact that I was a competent teacher made no difference to my critics . It took years to re-establish myself in a new career as a writer . In the meantime , I hemorrhaged debt . Now , five or so years later , I 've paid off most my credit cards , but I do n't expect I 'll ever pay off my student loans . With three degrees , and after years of deferment , the amount due hovers somewhere around $ 80,000 . Some people do n't get why . They ask : why did you go to a college you could n't afford ? Why did you pursue a second and then a third degree if you could n't pay off the first one ? Why did you pursue degrees in fields that will never pay off ? I used to feel ashamed .

{"src": "Talk to anyone involved in the action-movie glory days of the 1980s and the first thing they 'll say is that it 's time to bring those days back . `` In today 's world . we need heroes , '' Aaron Norris , brother of Chuck and an important behind-the-scenes figure in that heyday , told us when we interviewed him recently . `` Our action movies have gotten too artsy . '' Artsy sort of left the room this weekend , when Sylvester Stallone 's `` The Expendables , '' which assembled a team of muscle-bound mercenaries to fight indisputably evil ( but ideologically harmless ) enemies in far-off lands , got audiences excited , to Until this weekend , old-school action movies -- defined , for argument 's sake , as films with a slew of explosions , a shortage of moral ambiguity and a triumph of physical effects over digital ones -- had seen better days . It 's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system , and a lot longer since they were stateside successes . Many of the attempts in recent years have been , at best , mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences ( Stallone 's own which topped out at $ 42 million domestically ) or post-modern winks ( the French-language `` JCVD '' from 2008 , a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself ) . The few large-scale attempts , like `` The A-Team , '' underperformed . ( The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $ 77 million domestically , a number that will likely be easily surpassed by `` The Expendables . '' ) But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging , take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world ( it takes place in a fictional country , for starters ) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies ( `` We will kill this American disease , '' as the TV spot enticed us ) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre . And this weekend , the movie showed that there 's life in that category yet . That `` Scott Pilgrim vs. the World , '' the tongue-in-cheek , pop-culture-referential , decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for , of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind `` The Expendables '' only drove home the point more loudly . On one hand , it 's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism ( OK , first-world Western heroism ) would catch on . In fact , it 's surprising it did n't happen sooner . Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry . Why not a film hit too ? But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of `` The Expendables '' -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras ; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow does n't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them . Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval , in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq , that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst ( and that , indeed , the movie-going world can support a lot more of them ) . But history argues the opposite : Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions . On the other hand , when the zeitgeist is more cloudy , an entirely different kind of cinema prospers . The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil , to take an example of the former , yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers . And 30 years later , the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which `` Expendables '' is modeled ( not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections , `` Rocky IV . '' Yes , there 's a Stallone-ishness to all of this ) . There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s , but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part . The examples are just as abundant on the other side . The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of `` Midnight Cowboy '' and scores of others . In the post-9/11 world , meanwhile , movies like -- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that ca n't be bargained with , and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination . You can throw in there too , to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East . Political eras are , of course , rarely just one thing or another , and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic . But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of `` The Expendables '' shows a deeper cultural need , it may well be the wrong inference . When times are confusing , we want movies to reflect that confusion , and even to make sense of it . But we probably do n't want to pretend that confusion does n't exist .

{"src": "MUMBAI , India – A simple vinegar test slashed cervical cancer death rates by one-third in a remarkable study of 150,000 women in the slums of India , where the disease is the top cancer killer of women . Doctors reported the results Sunday at a cancer conference in Chicago . Experts called the outcome `` amazing '' and said this quick , cheap test could save tens of thousands of lives each year in developing countries by spotting early signs of cancer , allowing treatment before it 's too late . Usha Devi , one of the women in the study , says it saved her life . `` Many women refused to get screened . Some of them died of cancer later , '' Devi said . `` Now I feel everyone should get tested . I got my life back because of these tests . '' Pap smears and tests for HPV , a virus that causes most cervical cancers , have slashed cases and deaths in the United States . But poor countries ca n't afford those screening tools . This study tried a test that costs very little and can be done by local people with just two weeks of training and no fancy lab equipment . They swab the cervix with diluted vinegar , which can make abnormal cells briefly change color . This low-tech visual exam cut the cervical cancer death rate by 31 percent , the study found . It could prevent 22,000 deaths in India and 72,600 worldwide each year , researchers estimate . `` That 's amazing . That 's remarkable . It 's a very exciting result , '' said Dr. Ted Trimble of the National Cancer Institute in the U.S. , the main sponsor of the study . The story of research participant Usha Devi is not an unusual one . Despite having given birth to four children , she had never had a gynecological exam . She had been bleeding heavily for several years , hoping patience and prayers would fix things . `` Everyone said it would go away , and every time I thought about going to the doctor there was either no money or something else would come up , '' she said , sitting in a tiny room that serves as bedroom , kitchen , bathroom and living room for her entire family . One day she found a card from health workers trying to convince women to join the study . Devi is in her late 40s and like many poor Indians does n't know her date of birth . She learned she had advanced cervical cancer . The study paid for surgery to remove her uterus and cervix . The research effort was led by Dr. Surendra Shastri of Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai . India has nearly one-third of the world 's cases of cervical cancer — more than 140,000 each year . `` It 's just not possible to provide Pap smear screening in developing countries . We do n't have that kind of money '' or the staff or equipment , so a simpler method had to be found , Shastri said . Starting in 1998 , researchers enrolled 75,360 women to be screened every two years with the vinegar test . Another 76,178 women were chosen for a control , or comparison group that just got cancer education at the start of the study and vouchers for a free Pap test — if they could get to the hospital to have one . Women in either group found to have cancer were offered free treatment at the hospital . Still , this quick and free cancer screening was a hard sell in a deeply conservative country where women are subservient and need permission from husbands , fathers or others for even routine decisions . Social workers were sent into the slums to win people over . `` We went to every single house in the neighborhood assigned to us introducing ourselves and asking them to come to our health talks . They used to come out of curiosity , listen to the talk but when we asked them to get screened they would totally refuse , '' said one social worker , Vaishnavi Bhagat . `` The women were both scared and shy . '' One woman who did agree to testing jumped up from the table when she was examined with a speculum . `` She started screaming that we had stolen her kidney , '' Bhagat said . Another health worker was beaten by people in the neighborhood when women realized they would have to disrobe to be screened . `` There was a sense of shame about taking their clothes off . A lot of them had their babies at home and had never been to a doctor , '' said one health worker , Urmila Hadkar . `` Sometimes just the idea of getting tested for cancer scared them . They would start crying even before being tested . '' But screening worked . The quality of screening by health workers was comparable to that of an expert gynecologist , researchers reported . The study was planned for 16 years , but results at 12 years showed lives were saved with the screening . So independent monitors advised offering it to the women in the comparison group . An ethics controversy developed during the study . The U.S. Office for Human Research Protections faulted researchers for not adequately informing participants in the comparison group about Pap tests for screening . A letter from the agency in March indicated officials seemed to accept many of the remedies study leaders had implemented . `` We looked at the ethics very carefully '' and felt them to be sound , and visited the project in India , said Trimble of the National Cancer Institute . Dr. Sandra Swain , a cancer specialist at Medstar Washington Hospital Center , also defended the research . She is president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology , and the research results were presented at that group 's meeting in Chicago on Sunday . `` There really was no wrongdoing there , '' she said . `` They have no screening anyway , '' so there is no standard of care now . Officials in India already are making plans to expand the vinegar testing to a wider population . Many poor countries ca n't afford mammograms for breast cancer screening either . The India study also has been testing breast exams by health workers as an alternative .

This is not going away . But , Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message . Because he will be asked about this at every turn , Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change—based upon real science—and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy . The two are easy to do . Start with the obvious . Instead of waffling on the subject , he could just point out that earth 's surface temperature is about 1°C warmer than it was a century ago . There were two periods of warming , the first from about 1910 through 1945 , and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s . They were both roughly the same magnitude . Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere , Newt can say—with scientific authority—that the magnitude of 'natural ' climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done . Then Newt should proceed to the future . It 's not the heat , it 's the sensitivity . How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide . There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated . The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science . Next , a little refreshing honesty : in 2009 , the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill ( which the Senate did not ) commanding that the average american—38 years from now—be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867 . Prior to its passage , Newt was undeniably for such a system . Newt could call that that the `` second dumbest thing '' he has done and be finished with it . After setting the record straight , how about interjecting his own political philosophy ? When asked what to do about global warming , he should give the honest answer : if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought , the correct response is nothing . That 's because `` nothing '' really means something . Newt should channel his historian . When markets are free , capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they are n't . Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years . Is n't it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century , if only we do n't hinder capital development ? Newt might even use the catchy saw ( first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972 ) the future belongs to the efficient , and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things . When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions , he might point out that those were the same folks who , only a very few years ago , told us we were running out of natural gas . Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale , and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet . There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa .", "ref_summs": "Gingrich 's photo with Nancy Pelosi is not going away .

'' `` Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to … essentially enact the Romney economic plan . The American people rejected that , and Republicans should n't be doubling down on it . '' The White House effort comes three days before Obama releases his 2014 budget , which is expected to include a mix of tax increases and cuts to such entitlements as Social Security and Medicare . `` You can do both , '' Pfeiffer said on ABC 's `` This Week . '' `` That 's what you 'll see . … What we wo n't do is cut our way to prosperity . '' However , the outline of the plan has already been criticized by Republicans and some of the president 's staunchest supporters . The release of the budget Wednesday , which will be followed by Obama meeting for dinner with Senate Republicans , is just part of a busy week in Washington . Congress returns from a two-week break with the Senate attempting to reach a bipartisan agreement on immigration-reform legislation , and the leaders of the Democrat-controlled chamber trying to finish a gun-control proposal that might or might not include the contentious universal background checks for buyers . Pfeiffer told Fox the meeting with Senate Republicans is simply an attempt to find a `` caucus of common sense , '' not end run leaders of the Republican-controlled House . Last week , House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , said Obama 's budget blueprint holds reforms `` hostage '' to tax increases . Organized labor also expressed its disappointment in the plan . `` The president should drop these misguided cuts in benefits and focus instead on building support in Congress for investing in jobs , '' AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said . Obama supporters disagree particularly with the part of his spending plan that calls for a new inflation formula that would reduce the annual cost of living adjustments for a range of government programs , including Social Security and benefits for veterans . Still , South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham expressed optimism Sunday about the plan , suggesting it was at least a starting point toward an elusive , long-term budget deal between Democrats and Republicans . `` The president is showing a little bit of leg here , '' Graham said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' `` This is somewhat encouraging . We 're beginning to set the stage for the grand bargain . '' Among the highlights of the president 's plan is spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $ 1.8 trillion over 10 years , replacing the $ 1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts , known as sequester , over the same period . The proposal also is expected to include new spending for public works projects , early education and job training , as well as $ 580 billion in new taxes that Republicans oppose . Counting reductions and higher taxes that Congress and Obama have approved since 2011 , the 2014 budget would contribute $ 4.3 trillion to total deficit reduction by 2023 . On Saturday , the president said his budget was not his `` ideal plan , '' but it was a compromise that he would be willing to accept . The House and Senate have already passed their own budget plans . The House plan cuts $ 5.7 trillion in spending and balances the budget in 10 years while the Senate plan increases taxes by $ 1 trillion .

{"src": "Kenneth Ng calls his website a primer for tourists headed to , but Fodor 's it ai n't . The California State University at Northridge professor 's site is a one-stop shop for men drawn to the country 's sex tourism industry . Dotted with pictures of scantily clad women , the website , BigBabyKenny , advises would-be Johns on the art of negotiating with prostitutes . `` Start with a compliment , '' Ng advises . Needless to say , Ng 's website is causing headaches for Northridge administrators . First publicized by the Los Angeles Daily News , the economics professor 's site has drawn a wave of unwelcome attention , forcing administrators to at once criticize its content and defend Ng 's right to publish freely on his own time without university resources . `` Until we find representative evidence that it infringes upon the work he does at the university itself , there 's not much we can do about it , '' said Harold Hellenbrand , Northridge 's provost . There may be subtlety in Hellenbrand 's words , but his message is clear : If BigBabyKenny infringes on Ng 's ability to effectively do his job , then Northridge 's position will change . Ng has already said his site is run through a separate server not connected to the university , but Northridge officials might still make a case that the site has interfered with his job . Asked if students complaining that they were no longer comfortable in Ng 's class would compel Northridge to demand the site be taken down , Hellenbrand said `` I 'm not inviting complaints , but you just hit on the key issue . '' `` If [ running the site is ] what he wants to do , and at the same time he wants to educate students and students flock away , then that would create a problem , '' Hellenbrand said . How Ng came to be identified as the author of BigBabyKenny is a story in itself . A frequent tourist of Thailand , Ng took to blogging on the website of a Bangkok bar called Big Mango Bar . In one controversial post , Ng advised men to seek women near a particular Buddhist shrine . `` The naysayers will say its creepy to be hanging around the Muariti Shrine , hitting on the emotionally vulnerable girls desperately praying and paying Buddha for a better love life but I beg to differ . Buddha works in mysterious ways , '' he wrote . Perturbed by the post , the bar owners removed it . That led Ng to start his own site , prompting what Ng describes as a concerted effort by the owners to publicize his penchant for writing about prostitutes . They sent mass e-mails to faculty listed in Northridge 's directory , and also posted on RateMyProfessor.com , warning students about Ng , he said . Ng readily defends the content of his site and says he has no intention of taking it down . `` The university has no stake in this one way or the other , and besides , professors can say whatever they want , '' said Ng , a tenured associate professor of economics . Some question whether Ng has crossed a gray legal line , however , by advising men on sex tourism . Patrick Trueman , a former U.S. justice department official , notes that there are several federal statutes that could come into play . Within U.S. Code 18 are two sections – 2422 ( a ) and 2422 ( b ) – that specifically prohibit anyone from `` enticing or coercing a person '' to travel internationally in pursuit of prostitutes . Moreover , one section specifically prohibits the use of the Internet to lure people . While prostitution may be tolerated in Thailand , that 's immaterial under the federal code , Trueman said . `` Inducing and enticing ? Is n't that what this guy 's doing ? '' said Trueman , former chief of the Justice Department 's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section in the Criminal Division . Trueman , now a lawyer specializing in sex trafficking and child abuse cases , said there would likely be debate about whether talking about procuring prostitutes online and actually arranging prostitutes for a person should be treated differently under the law . `` Given how lax the fed government is on these crimes , they may not charge somebody unless they are more directly involved , '' he said . `` That 's not to say this person could n't be charged , and as I read it they could be charged . '' Beyond the legal implications , critics have already attacked Ng on moral grounds . John Foubert , an Oklahoma State University professor who researches sex trafficking , argues that women – often minors – are forced into the sex tourism industry and often have trouble escaping it . Even if Ng is operating within the bounds of the law , Northridge officials have an ethical problem they 've yet to face , Foubert said . `` Do they want to live with the blood on their hands of these girls that are being essentially raped by these men , who are going down and purchasing sex ? I think that 's a larger question , '' said Foubert , an associate professor of college student development . Ng said he allows anything to be written on his site , so long as it does n't involve pedophilia or underage sex . He does , however , write about how difficult it is to effectively negotiate with a `` half or sometimes fully naked teenage girl '' when she 's `` expertly gyrating '' on a man 's lap . While his critics have been speaking out since fall , Ng said he has yet to hear from a student who expressed discomfort about his website . `` The job of the university is to expose students to the world – not just a politically correct view of the world and not just the good parts of the world , '' he said . `` If a student reads that [ site ] , I personally think it 's good for them . They learn about something out there ; maybe they disapprove of it and they do n't think it 's good . '' You share in the USA TODAY community , so please keep your comments smart and civil .

Ciancia returned and shot again , making Gerardo Hernandez , 39 , a married father-of-two , the TSA 's first fatality in the line of duty since the agency 's creation after 9/11 . The gunman carried a note which said he wished to kill as many TSA employees `` and pigs '' as possible , without racial discrimination , to `` instill fear into their traitorous minds '' , FBI special agent in charge David Bowdich told reporters . The note singled out Janet Napolitano , a former head of homeland security , for abuse and cited `` NWO '' , an apparent reference to a conspiracy theory about authoritarian government plotting a new world order . Ciancia also wrote that he intended to die after killing at least one security officer , Reuters quoted the head of a key congressional security committee as saying on Sunday . He also discussed weaknesses in airport security in the `` suicide '' note before Friday 's attack , Michael McCaul , the Republican chair of the House committee on homeland security , told CNN . `` The other thing he wanted to talk about was how easy it is to bring a gun into an airport and do something just like he did , '' McCaul said of the note . McCaul said the note allegedly written by Ciancia `` talks a lot about killing TSA agents , and he said , 'If I just kill one , my mission is accomplished . ' '' It was not immediately clear whether McCaul was referring to the same note as the one mentioned by the FBI , Reuters reported . Ciancia , wearing an armoured vest , used a Smith & Wesson .223 caliber M & P-15 assault rifle to wound two other TSA agents and a passenger in a 10-minute shooting spree which spread panic through the world 's sixth-busiest airport and disrupted thousands of flights . Airport police cornered him near a Burger King in Terminal 3 and shot him in the leg and mouth , reportedly smashing his teeth and tongue . Ciancia managed to tell officials at the scene that a friend had driven him to LAX but that he had acted alone , according to the Associated Press . A graphic photo in the New York Post showed Ciancia on the ground with a mangled face and beside pools of blood . By Saturday Ciancia , under guard at hospital , was `` unresponsive '' and could not be interviewed , said Bowdich . He was charged with first-degree murder and committing violence at an international airport and may face the death penalty . Authorities believe the friend who dropped Ciancia off in a black Hyundai on Friday morning was unaware of his plan . Ciancia had no ticket or reservation . Los Angeles police wore black armbands in tributes to Hernandez , the slain agent . He move to the US from El Salvador at the age of 15 and joined the TSA three years ago , routinely rising at 3am for his shift . His widow , Ana Hernandez , flanked by TSA chief John Pistole , told a press conference the family had lost a loving husband and father . `` I am truly devastated , '' she said . Later she told NBC : `` He was always excited to go to work . He was a joyful person , he took pride in his duty for the American public and for the TSA mission . '' The FBI said it had found no evidence that Ciancia consorted with radical groups but hoped to establish why he had a grudge against the TSA , said Bowdich . `` We are really going to draw a picture of who this person was , his background , his history . That will help us explain why he chose to do what he did . At this point , I do n't have the answer on that . '' Ciancia grew up in Pennsville , a blue-collar New Jersey suburb , and was described by former classmates as quiet and reserved . His father owned a successful garage . His mother died of multiple sclerosis in 2009 . Two years later , Ciancia graduated from the Motorcycle Mechanics Institute in Orlando , which taught him to fix Harley-Davidsons . Soon after , he moved to Los Angeles . He struggled to find work . Last week he alarmed siblings with texts suggesting he would would harm himself .", "ref_summs": "Paul Ciancia wounded in leg and mouth , leaving agents to piece together details of airport spree which killed TSA agent", "sys_summs": {"lede3": {"sys_summ": "Transportation Security Administration agents walk back to work at LAX .

{"src": "Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded . The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery , but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves . Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter , Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia 's James River . Butler , certainly no abolitionist , nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner , labeling them `` contrabands of war . '' The term , suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives , found immediate acceptance . As one Union officer wrote , `` Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time . '' Within weeks hundreds of `` contrabands '' — men , women and children — flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions . Unsure what might greet them , the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement . It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom . In August 1861 , the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership , but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free . The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery , and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were `` captives of war '' and would be set free . These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory . The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps . A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi , Tennessee and Cumberland River systems . Grant 's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi . Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area . Lincoln 's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22 , 1862 , produced an even greater flood of refugees . How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant 's command . `` You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe 's Proclamation is making , '' wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September . The contrabands `` will not even wait until 1st January . I do not know what we shall do with them . '' Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition . `` There were men , women , and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked , with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape , '' wrote one observer . `` Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind . '' On Nov. 11 , 1862 , Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis : he named John Eaton , a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry , as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work `` organizing them into suitable companies for working . '' A month later he went further . `` The negroes will be clothed , and in every way provided for , out of their earnings '' — about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked — `` so far as practicable , '' he ordered . `` In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government , or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity . '' Grant 's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines . Personally , Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees . He seems to have recognized that , in the words of one observer , `` The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner . '' Nevertheless , the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton 's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war 's most successful contraband camps , located at Corinth , Miss . Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander , chaplain of the 66th Illinois , the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September . Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops , the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets , which were named for Union generals . Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school , a commissary , a hospital , a church and an office . The entire camp was divided into wards , complete with ward masters and a police force . In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for , educate and minister to the freedmen . In a memoir written years after the war , one such missionary recalled her experience . `` When brought face to face with the slaves , '' she wrote , `` it was like the discovery of a new race . '' The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation . The freedmen 's thirst for knowledge was undeniable . `` You will find them every hour of daylight , at their books , '' observed the Rev . Edward Pierce in March of 1863 . `` We can not enter a cabin , or tent , but that we see from one to three with books . '' Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students , and by the end of the summer , the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school . In August , one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp . Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education . Reverend Olds `` saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen . And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses , '' he said , `` I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these ? '' The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000 , as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations . In March 1863 , for example , the camp was home to 658 men , 1,440 women and 1,559 children . Among the men were 36 blacksmiths , 48 carpenters , 180 teamsters and 200 cooks . The female ranks included 80 seamstresses , 150 laundresses and 600 cooks . Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married , and seven in eight women had children . According to John Eaton 's records , the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness , 189 deaths and 45 births . Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj . Gen. Lorenzo Thomas , who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments . With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent , later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops , the camp lost most of its able-bodied men . Their departure to fight left only the women , the young , the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton 's ambitious agricultural program , which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land . The program put 400 acres under cultivation , 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables . Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden . By May 1863 , the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 for the government , as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps . Unfortunately , the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived . Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause . The order to relocate the camp 's inhabitants 93 miles westward , to Memphis , `` fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people , '' lamented one missionary , `` but military orders are preemptory , '' and they `` must be obeyed . '' The freedmen left their `` well-organized village , '' gardens and farms to tdiv > The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen 's success . Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis , but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city . `` The destruction of the Corinth camp , '' noted one historian , `` was one of the tragedies of the Civil War . '' Eaton 's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere . And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership , well-planned and policed living environment , and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success . Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864 , the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America .

{"src": "Termed a `` man of enough words '' recently by Jim Harbaugh , 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick needed just three syllables Sunday to explain why wide receiver Michael Crabtree has emerged as his favorite target . In San Francisco 's past three games , Crabtree has been targeted 34 times , 20 more than wide receiver Randy Moss , who is second in targets over that span . Tight end Vernon Davis ? He has eight targets in the past three games . It 's hard to argue with Kaepernick 's pecking order , given the results . In a 41-34 win over the Patriots on Sunday , Crabtree ( 7 catches , 107 yards , 2 TDs ) was featured on the 49ers ' first possession - a tone-setting 63-yard touchdown march - with drive-opening catches of 11 and 13 yards . Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree , a 38-yard game-winner on a play that was n't designed for San Francisco 's No . 1 wide receiver . In his past three games , Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game . Prior to his streak , he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career . In his five starts , Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree , who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands . According to Pro Football Focus , Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick 's starts , an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws . On KNBR Tuesday , Harbaugh , who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he 'd ever seen , crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry . `` Yeah , I think there is , '' Harbaugh said . `` But Michael has been doing this all year now . Talked about it every week , the ability to catch , nobody catches the ball better than Michael Crabtree . I think back to last summer when we were talking about the same topic . It might have even been on this show . A lot of people 'What ? The greatest hands you 've ever seen ? ' Nobody mentions that any more . Boy , the evidence sure is there . '' With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games , Crabtree ( 73 catches , 868 yards ) would become the 49ers ' first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002 . Davis , who had team-highs in targets ( eight ) , receptions ( six ) and yards ( 83 ) in Kaepernick 's first start against Chicago last month , has since become an afterthought . He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots , and four catches , 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games . Davis said he 's yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith . `` You have to develop that chemistry , that bond so you can be on the same page , '' Davis said . `` That 's something me and Kaep do n't have right now . We do n't have it . You have to expect it because he just stepped in . Me and Alex , we 've been here . '' Asked why Crabtree has been quick to get on the same page , Davis said the red-hot wide receiver has been running shorter routes . However , he also noted , as Kaepernick did Sunday night , that Crabtree has earned his targets by breaking free from coverage . `` Crab is a pretty good route runner , '' Davis said . `` He 's getting open and Kaep is finding him .

{"src": "WASHINGTON — President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology . The president 's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia 's ambassador to the United States . If the United Nations ' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence , including new data from recent months , it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies , including Israel , should move to halt Iran 's suspected weapons program . Over the longer term , several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews , they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran 's central bank — a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations . Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country 's elite military force , the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps . The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program , and they are the parent of the Quds Force , which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot . The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do — as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran , with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers ' lists . All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks . Yukiya Amano , the cautious director general of the United Nations group , the International Atomic Energy Agency , talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads . But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran , shutting the best , though narrow , window into its nuclear activities . Similarly , China and Russia , among other major Iranian trading partners , have resisted further oil and financial sanctions , saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy . Even inside the Obama administration , some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak . As one senior official put it , `` You do n't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians . '' Senior administration officials , who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions , say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama , who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the `` toughest sanctions '' for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy . The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered , but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court , public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence . Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer , but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon . Instead , it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device , including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel , how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast , and how to make detonators , generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction , measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles . Tommy Vietor , the spokesman for the National Security Council , said Saturday that `` the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran 's nuclear program and what to do about it . '' Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are `` fabrications '' intended to justify an attack . The country has been the target of covert attacks , including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran 's nuclear centrifuges . The Obama administration , since coming to office , has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly , should it need it . But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies . In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because , after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003 , any American evidence is considered suspect . Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run . But Iran is a different kind of case . Inspectors visit regularly , measuring Iran 's output of uranium , including recent production of the material , enriched to 20 percent purity , that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon . Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor , which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use .", "ref_summs": "President Obama wants United Nations inspectors to release intelligence showing that Iranâs nuclear program is designing and experimenting with weapons technology .", "sys_summs": {"lede3": {"sys_summ": "WASHINGTON -- President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology .

I have to show malice . Could it be any clearer what the malice is ? I do n't even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show . It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize , '' she said . As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday , the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh 's remarks . Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh 's claims , she earns no self-awareness points . By saying `` You ca n't maliciously attack people , '' Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh 's 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke , then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans . Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a `` slut , '' a `` prostitute '' and many other things . The Washington Post 's Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh 's fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case : All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life . Here 's the thing : She did n't . She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life . She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all : She spoke passionately and eloquently , and respectfully , about several friends of hers , Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill , but who could not get it because they could not afford it . That was it . Here is the transcript of her testimony . Following a huge uproar , Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his `` word choices . '' Limbaugh & Co. , said Glaser , wants the DCCC to make amends : `` We want an apology . We want a retraction . And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated , '' she told Hannity . As for the Fox News host , he sounded excited about a legal proceeding : `` You know what , it 's a serious issue , because I think you 're right , '' Hannity said . `` And as somebody that works in this business , this happens all the time . And in this case I believe they so crossed the line . It 's going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts . I think they 're going to be surprised .

{"src": "A French teenager who was infected with HIV as a baby and given intensive drug therapy in early childhood has lived for more than 12 years without any treatment , raising hopes among scientists searching for a cure for Aids . The case of the 18-year-old was presented at an Aids conference in Vancouver , Canada , by doctors at the Institut Pasteur who treated her . Like the so-called Mississippi baby , she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the first weeks of her life . Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs . The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson . Doctors talked in terms of a `` functional cure '' , because the child had no detectable virus . However , the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child 's body . HIV scientists confessed to disappointment , although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case . This time there is more caution . It is the first case of long-term remission in a child , say the French team , but they accept that it may not be permanent . The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for six weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection , but to no avail . Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped , tests showed the infant had a high viral load and she was put on a cocktail of three antiretroviral medicines , which is the standard treatment for HIV . When the girl was six years old , the family decided to stop the drugs and for six months doctors did not have contact with her . But when she was brought back , tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body . Twelve years and no drugs later , it is still undetectable – although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir . There are people known as `` elite controllers '' whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay , but according to Dr Asier Sáez-Cirión , of the HIV , inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris , the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those . `` Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection . '' That happened with a group of 14 adults in France , known as the Visconti cohort . They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus , even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago . Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body 's immune system defences . Sáez-Cirión said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies , of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life . Of those , 15 stopped treatment , but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them . Of the two remaining , one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years . She has a healthy life with no complications , but this girl is not cured . We 're talking about remission `` She is doing perfectly well , '' said Sáez-Cirión . `` She has a healthy life with no complications . '' But he added : `` Very clearly this girl is not cured . We 're talking about remission . '' The case was presented at the eighth International Aids Society ( IAS ) Conference on HIV pathogenesis , treatment and prevention . Prof Sharon Lewin , director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia , said she thought it was interesting , but added : `` We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure … the child received medication early after birth . We do n't know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication . About 1 % of people can do that . '' Lewin , a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure , said trials were needed . It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis . Itwas possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs , but that had to be properly tested . `` The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop , '' she said . `` These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment .

The congressionally mandated switch to digital broadcasting that went into effect on June 12 is a boon toDG FastChannel ( dgIT , 19 ) , which distributes advertising spots to tv stations and other outlets . In the old days videotapes of ads were shipped to broadcasters . DG puts servers at broadcasters ' sites that receive ads electronically , charging customers less than they 'd pay for physical delivery . Two-thirds of ads today are electronically distributed , and DG owns the lion 's share of the market . As advertisers shoot more commercials in high definition , DG has the opportunity to boost revenue because it charges more for hd content . Juicy margins will invite competition , but DG 's large network of stations creates a significant barrier to entry .

American Superconductor ( AMSC - news - people ) ( AMSC , 25 ) is benefiting from increasing spending on wind power by the Chinese government . as sells wind turbine designs and associated power electronics . Two-thirds of its revenue comes from Sinovel , a state-owned Chinese company . That is both good and bad . The dependence on Sinovel was a big help during last year 's downturn , but in the future it could be a significant risk . as also makes high-temperature superconducting wire with carrying capacity 150 times that of copper wire , perfect for the global upgrade to a more efficient electrical grid . The superconductor division is not yet profitable , but the rest of the business should earn $ 1.35 a share over the next year . I expect 30 % annual earnings gains over the next five years . Fuel Tech ( FTEK , 10 ) develops technology to reduce nitrogen oxide ( NOX ) emissions from power plants . Fuel Tech stumbled last summer when the U.S. District Court of Appeals vacated the Environmental Protection Agency 's rule spelling out timetables for NOX reduction across the eastern half of the U.S . In a surprise move the same Court of Appeals reinstated the Clean Air Interstate Rule in December , and it went into effect on Jan. 1 as originally scheduled . Fuel Tech also sells chemicals that are tossed into a coal burner to fight slag and thereby boost power plant efficiency . The company generates most of its revenue in the U.S. , but management is looking to expand in emerging markets like China and eastern Europe , where pollution-control technology is still quite new . Fuel Tech shares look expensive at 78 times my earnings projection of 15 cents a share for the 12 months beginning in July , but I expect rapid growth . It is reasonable to expect earnings of 60 cents a share in 2010 . President Obama 's proposed focus on cybersecurity will benefit ArcSight ( ARST - news - people ) ( ARST , 17 ) . ArcSight 's software collects and correlates user activity and event data across an enterprise so that businesses can rapidly identify and respond to compliance violations , policy breaches , cyberattacks and insider threats . For example , if a user is logged in to the network from home and subsequently tries to enter the office by scanning his badge at the entrance , an alert is issued . ArcSight 's software was developed for the government , and its client list boasts 20 federal agencies . Corporations are adopting ArcSight to comply with data-security provisions of such laws as Sarbanes-Oxley and the health care privacy paperwork statute that goes by the acronym HIPAA .

{"src": "It is not unreasonable to speculate that Maria Sharapova indulged in a loud celebration of Serena Williams 's crushing loss to the world No35 Garbiñe Muguruza in the second round of this French Open . They are not close , the Russian and the American , whom she has not managed to beat since 2004 , when she prevailed in the final at Wimbledon , aged 17 . For an hour or so on Tuesday , however , the schadenfreude resided with the chastened world No1 back in Miami , as the lean-limbed young Spanish upstart looked like adding Sharapova to her short but impressive hit list of celebrity take-downs . She was poised to embarrass the faltering seventh seed after a first-set blitz of powerful , confident hitting from all angles , but the grind got to her . Sharapova , as she has done now in her past 18 three-setters on clay ( and 25 of 26 overall ) , was too strong of mind and body over the longer distance , taking a tick over two hours to win 1-6 , 7-5 , 6-1 . So the tournament gets the glamour semi-final it craved : Sharapova , thrashed by Williams in last year 's final , against the rising Canadian Eugenie Bouchard , who had a marginally tougher time of it on Court Suzanne Lenglen . She held off the spirited challenge of another Spaniard , the 14th seed Carla Suárez Navarro , to win 7-6 , 2-6 , 7-5 in two hours and 22 minutes , and bootleg seats on Court Philippe Chatrier for their match on Thursday will sell like those along the catwalk in Milan . Muguruza , in her first slam quarter-final and with nothing to lose , came close to securing a footnote in the game 's history as the first player to beat both Sharapova and Williams in the same slam . However , Muguruza 's tennis disintegrated into shards of overcooked groundstrokes as the fist-pumping diva at the other end again dipped into her considerable reserves of determination . On Lenglen shortly afterwards , Bouchard hit a double fault on match point but repaired the damage with a stunning cross-court backhand and tried again . As with Muguruza , Suárez Navarro left the stage with a limp , netted backhand , struck single-handedly . Both are interesting players with big games . If they are to break through when it matters , though , they will have to cope with the added pressure of expectation . Bouchard has taken just 10 games off Sharapova in 30 , baggage that will be hard to carry into the first semi-final . But , like Muguruza , she has nothing to lose . Sharapova had difficulty later understanding a tweet by Andy Murray 's mother , Judy , and swore she had no idea who she was . The tweet was simple and clever – `` Sharapova is like a tea bag . Put her into hot water , and ul find out how strong she is '' – but the player looked nonplussed . And when Sharapova was reminded of a photo of her with Bouchard as a young girl , currently hitting the airwaves on Twitter , she struggled to recall the moment . `` My first memory ? Probably when she was playing the juniors . I do n't know how many years that was ago . I think when she received a wildcard into a tournament in Canada . '' Sharapova does tennis . She is not big on jokes and sentiment . The women nevertheless outshone the men on day 10 , although Ernests Gulbis sustained his eye-catching run with a stylish , serve-led demolition of Tomas Berdych that will give the world No2 Novak Djokovic plenty to ponder before their semi-final on Thursday . On a buzzing Lenglen court , Gulbis , by a little way the most intriguing figure in the men 's game , with talent to back his candour , allowed himself a lightbulb smile when Berdych stuck his closing effort into the netting . Coming off the best result of his wayward career – over Roger Federer in five sets on Sunday – he showed he had plenty left in his some times unreliable legs to win 6-3 , 6-2 , 6-4 , in three minutes less than it took Sharapova to beat Muguruza . won his match 6-3 , 6-2 , 6-4 , but Djokovic made much harder work of beating Milos Raonic , who fought hard all the way to the end of the first two sets then launched a late fightback from 1-5 in the third before the Serb closed it out on his own serve , 7-5 , 7-6 , 6-4 . It might well have sounded absurd to say Gulbis would be a credible challenger for this title after he lost his first set of the tournament , 4-6 against the world No63 Lukasz Kubot . If he wins his last set of the tournament , we will be writing quite a different story .", "ref_summs": "The 2012 champion reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros with a 1-6 , 7-5 , 6-1 victory against her 20-year-old Spanish opponent", "sys_summs": {"lede3": {"sys_summ": "It is not unreasonable to speculate that Maria Sharapova indulged in a loud celebration of Serena Williams 's crushing loss to the world No35 Garbiñe Muguruza in the second round of this French Open .

{"src": "Writer-director Richard Linklater has described his latest film , `` Everybody Wants Some ! ! , '' as a `` spiritual sequel '' to 1993 's `` Dazed and Confused . '' That made my heart fibrillate a little , and maybe yours too . Beginning with its shot of a Pontiac GTO pulling doughnuts in a high school parking lot to Aerosmith 's `` Sweet Emotion , '' `` Dazed '' is such a humane approximation of what it was like to come of age in the mid-1970s that one wishes it would never end . On the evidence of `` Boyhood '' and the `` Before Sunrise '' trilogy , though , Linklater does n't want any of his movies to end . Thus `` Everybody Wants Some ! ! '' Which at first is different , sometimes jarringly so , before wading into the open-armed embrace of experience that marks this filmmaker 's finest work . The tipoffs are those double exclamation points and an onscreen title font that recalls a Skinemax late-night movie circa 1981 . What if you took one of that era 's hormone-drenched stu-coms and put real people in it ? The year is 1980 , actually , and Jake ( Blake Jenner from `` Glee '' ) is arriving for his freshman year at ( the fictional ) Southeastern Texas State University . A high school pitching star and rangy college prospect , he 's assigned an off-campus baseball dorm with the other players . It 's a ready-made animal house , with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach ( Jonathan Breck ) that are immediately ignored . Occasionally we 'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin . These , too , are ignored . Instead , Linklater parks his cameras to observe , with indulgence and much good humor , the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out . Jake 's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities : The motor-mouthed ladies ' man Finnegan ( Glen Powell ) , the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby ( Wyatt Russell ) , uber-competitive McReynolds ( Tyler Hoechlin ) , country rube Billy ( Will Brittain ) , smartass Nesbit ( Austin Amelio ) , naïve Brumley ( Tanner Kalina ) . And so on . A few stand slightly outside the pack : the over-confident psycho-nerd pitcher Jay Niles ( Juston Street , freakily funny ) and the laconic second base star Dale Douglas ( J. Quinton Johnson ) , whose blackness is rarely commented on . Where are the women ? There to be chased and partied with and seduced . `` This is college , Jake , '' the hero is told early on . `` The girls can be as big sluts as the guys . '' Oh , dear . Is `` Everybody Wants Some ! ! '' what happens when you people an entire Richard Linklater movie with Matthew McConaughey 's horndog Wooderson from `` Dazed and Confused '' ? Yes and no , or , rather , yes , but only at first . As the boys sprawl through the last days of summer , the swagger that borders on smug begins to mellow and melt away . Searching for good times and girls , they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party , minds open , adapting , ever-changing . After a while , the hero starts having a smallish identity crisis , confessing that `` it sort of begs the question of who we are . '' Well , yes . This is college , Jake . Even a high school sports star can be anyone he wants . The movie eventually spins him off from the crowd into the arms of Beverly ( Zoey Deutch ) , a tartly ardent stage arts freshman with Joni Mitchell posters on her wall . She 's unpretentious for a theater brat , he 's smart and soulful for a jock , and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction . These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway , and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine , it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of `` Back to the Future '' and `` Some Kind of Wonderful '' and her father is Howard Deutch , who directed the latter . More second-generation pleasures : Wyatt Russell , who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby , is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn , and he has a high old time — emphasis on high — explaining to his teammates why `` Fearless , '' from the 1971 album `` Meddle , '' is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded . Because he is correct , I am awarding `` Everybody Wants Some ! ! '' an extra half-star . Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship , and the movie is steeped in the lazy , rivalrous minutiae of college ball . Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching — `` It 's lovely out there on the bump , '' he says — and we learn that it 's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious . Also that it 's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax . At one point , one of the characters gazes with incredulity at a crowd of fellow students and says , `` I know what we 're doing here . We 're playing baseball . What are they doing here ? '' `` Everybody Wants Some ! ! '' is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era . Beverly drives a Gremlin , Jake knows the secret of winning at `` Space Invaders , '' and people can still confidently begin sentences with the words , `` It 's like Carl Sagan says . . . '' What `` Sweet Emotion '' was to `` Dazed and Confused , '' so the Knack 's `` My Sharona '' is to this movie , and the soundtrack rolls forward from there : glorious junk from the days when Eddie Rabbitt , Eddie Money , Sniff ' n ' the Tears , and the BusBoys meant something . All that 's missing is a plot . But Linklater does n't do plot ; he does life . Says Powell 's garrulous Finnegan , summing up the art of both this movie and this moviemaker , `` I do n't think at all . I just talk a lot . It 's jazz improv . You 're invited . '' And so are we .

{"src": "Here are top moments from the House Select Committee hearing on Benghazi where former secretary of state Hillary Clinton testified . ( Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post ) The House Select Committee on Blumenthal , as some are now calling it , came to order at 10 a.m . Lawmakers did n't finish questioning Hillary Clinton until 11 hours later — just after the Democratic presidential candidate succumbed to a coughing fit . In that period of time , the name of Sidney Blumenthal was invoked more than 75 times , and scores of questions were asked about the longtime Clinton friend . By lunchtime , Blumenthal had been invoked 49 times — exactly the number of mentions of J. Christopher Stevens , the ambassador to Libya whose death in Benghazi is the supposed subject of the congressional probe . The other three Americans slain in Benghazi — Sean Smith , Glen Doherty , Tyrone Woods — got seven or eight mentions apiece , then-CIA director David Petraeus and former defense secretary Robert Gates each got two , and then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had none . Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation 's capital . He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000 . Chairman Trey Gowdy ( R-S.C. ) , reading from Blumenthal 's e-mails to Clinton as if he were the teacher who had intercepted a note passed between two high school kids , said Blumenthal referred to Gates as `` a mean , vicious little '' — Gowdy paused . `` I 'm not going to say the word , but he did . '' He also quoted Blumenthal referring to then- national security adviser Thomas E. Donilon 's `` babbling rhetoric , '' and he said Blumenthal had referred to `` Obama '' ( he `` left the 'president ' part out '' ) and `` his political cronies in the White House and Chicago . '' Clinton refused to get riled . `` I do n't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four Americans , '' she said . But Gowdy knew . A couple of minutes later , he announced : `` I 'll tell you what : If you think you 've heard about Sidney Blumenthal so far , wait until the next round . '' He and his colleagues made good on that statement , posing questions on a Blumenthal visit to Clinton 's home , about his work for the Clinton Foundation , his business interests , his attempt to get a job at the State Department and his communication with the former secretary of state over matters as mundane as her new iPad . They were particularly concerned with whether Blumenthal 's advice to Clinton on Libya was `` unsolicited . '' The Blumenthal focus shows that , after 17 months of probing Clinton , the Benghazi committee has n't come up with much . Blumenthal has been a Clinton hatchet man for years , and he has an unsavory reputation . The very mention of his name ( he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal ) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation . But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe does n't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong . And the justification for invoking him — to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens — is a stretch . Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist — I 've clashed with him over the years — he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12 , 2012 . Rep. Mike Pompeo ( R-Kan. ) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself . Pompeo , who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got `` most of her intelligence '' on Libya from Blumenthal , asked whether Stevens had Clinton 's personal e-mail , her cellphone number , fax or home address or visited her at home . `` Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things , '' Pompeo concluded . Rep. Peter J. Roskam ( R-Ill. ) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to `` make a public statement before the cameras '' when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed . `` Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you 're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain , '' Roskam scolded . Relevance to the Benghazi attack ? None . Gowdy , for his part , found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal 's advice ( which he got from a former intelligence official ) to people including Stevens . `` It 's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal 's drivel , '' the chairman said , `` in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security . '' Rep. Adam B. Schiff ( Calif. ) , a Democrat , observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal , you 'd think `` that he was in Benghazi on the night , manning the barricades . '' During private testimony from Blumenthal , to which he was summoned by federal marshals , Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal 's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks . Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings ( Md . ) , the ranking Democrat , proposed that Republicans , rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal 's e-mails , come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony . Gowdy , after a shouting match with Cummings , refused .

With two children — now 31/2 and 1 1/2 — the Stahlbergs needed more space , including a study area for Stephanie , who is enrolled in a PhD program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies . The house they found in Cherrydale , a neighborhood in North Arlington , met their expectations . Within two days on the market , however , there were 10 offers . `` Our was not the highest , '' Stephanie said . `` We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house . '' The letter , along with a photograph of the family , worked . What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes — raspberries , blueberries , blackberries , strawberries , grapes , apples , plums and currants — growing organically on the property . The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair . They also fell in love with the neighborhood . They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children . `` We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro , or bike to the city or to the Metro , '' said Stephanie , 27 . Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses : Cherrydale , once abundant with cherry orchards , is a family neighborhood dating to 1893 . While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years , newcomers move in and out these days , said Kathryn Holt Springston , who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years . She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens ' Association newsletter . Single-family homes , the Arlington public schools , access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood . Sometimes , though , they move in but stay only a few years . Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced . About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines , Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more . Many date from 1900 to 1930 , though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes , including some built as recently as this year . Living there : Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane , stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east . The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway , lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale . Since 1908 , the Cherrydale Citizens ' Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns . In the 1970s and 1980s , people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry , according to Springston , 63 . In 1948 , her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son . It dates to 1890 , Springston said . In the neighborhood , 49 properties sold in the past year , according to Billy Buck , an associate broker at Buck & Associates . The lowest priced was a one-bedroom , one-bath condominium for $ 200,000 ; the highest priced was a five-bedroom , five-bath farmhouse at $ 1.63 million . Twelve properties are on the market now , ranging from a one-bedroom , two-bath condo for $ 274,900 to a new five-bedroom , five-bath Craftsman house at $ 1.799 million . Welcome wagon : The five-points intersection — Lee Highway , Old Dominion Drive , Quincy Street , Military Road and Quebec Street — is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware , which opened in 1938 . The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House , built in 1919 , is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner , concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12 . Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets . A neighborhood with its own `` welcome wagon , '' Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking , running and walking . Schools : Glebe Elementary , Taylor Elementary , Swanson Middle , Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High .

{"src": "MADRID ( AP ) – Spain 's grinding economic misery will get worse this year despite the country 's request for a European financial lifeline of up to $ 125 billion to save its banks , Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Sunday . A day after the country conceded it needed outside help following months of denying it would seek assistance , Rajoy said more Spaniards will lose their jobs in a country where one out of every four are already unemployed . `` This year is going to be a bad one , '' Rajoy said Sunday in his first comments about the rescue since it was announced the previous evening by his economy minister . The conservative prime minister added that the economy , stuck in its second recession in three years , will still contract the previously predicted 1.7 percent even with the help . Small businesses and families starving for credit will eventually get relief as the funding props up banks and they increase lending , but Rajoy did n't offer guidance on when . Spain on Saturday became the fourth — and largest — of the 17 countries that use Europe 's common currency to request a bailout — a big blow to a nation that a few years ago took pride as the continent 's economic superstar only to see it become the hot spot in the eurozone debt crisis . Its economy is the eurozone 's fourth largest after Germany , France and Italy . Across the country , Spaniards reacted with a mixture of anger and relief to the news . The amount of the rescue fund , if all is tapped , amounts to €21,000 of new debt for each person in the nation of 47 million where the average annual salary for those with work is about the same amount and the unemployment rate for those under age 25 is 52 percent . The country is already reeling from deep austerity cuts Rajoy has imposed over the last six months that have raised taxes , made it easier to hire and fire workers , and cut deep into cherished government programs including education and national health care . `` It 's obviously a shame , '' said civil servant Luisa Saraguren , 44 , as she strolled on a sunny Sunday morning with her young daughter . `` But this bailout was fully predictable , and the consequences of this help are going to be a lot bigger compared to the cuts we 've been living with already . '' Rajoy took pains to avoid the word bailout Sunday , saying Spain 's rescue package is a line of credit that its most troubled banks will be able to tap . The assistance will not come with the outside control over government macroeconomic policy like that imposed Greece , Ireland and Portugal when their public finances were bailed out . He said interest rates on the loans will be considerably lower than the rate near 7 percent that Spain has been forced to pay recently on the international debt markets , a level that forced the other countries to seek bailouts . Spain will regain the economic credibility it has lost by shoring up its banks , which will result in credit being restored so businesses and individuals shut off from loans can start borrowing and the economy will grow again , Rajoy insisted , again without saying when . Europe 's widening recession and financial crisis has hurt companies and investors around the world . Providing a financial lifeline to Spanish banks is likely to relieve anxiety on the Spanish economy — which is five times larger than Greece 's — and on markets concerned about the country 's ability to pay its way . Spain 's financial problems are not due to Greek-style government over-spending . The country 's banks particularly its savings banks or `` cajas , '' got caught up in the collapse of a real estate bubble in 2008 that got worse over the past four years . However , as Spain 's leaders have struggled for a solution to their banking crisis , the country 's borrowing costs have soared close to the level that forced the governments of Greece , Portugal and Ireland to seek rescues . Some of Spain 's banks are struggling with by toxic real estate loans and assets amid fears the problem will get worse as more jobless people ca n't pay their mortgages . The Bank of Spain says the toxic loans and assets total around €180 billion . Nationalized lender Bankia SA , which has requested €19 billion in aid , has €32 billion in toxic assets . Around four other banks serving the domestic market are considered prime candidates for bailouts . `` I could never get my mind round the scale of consumption in Spain over the past 20 years , having known it in the 1960s when it was still extremely poor , '' said Paul Preston , a history professor and expert on Spain with the London School of Economics . `` Lots of people enjoyed the consumer boom , but not everybody . Now everybody 's having to pay for it . '' Rajoy blamed Spain 's woes on the previous Socialist administration of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero without mentioning him or his government by name . Zapatero was ousted by Rajoy in a landslide last November by voters outraged over the Socialist handling of the economy . `` Last year Spain 's public administration spent €90 billion more than it took in , this ca n't be maintained , we ca n't live like that , '' Rajoy said . But Socialist Party leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Rajoy should acknowledge that Spain is now in bailout territory . `` The government is trying to make us believe that we 've won the lottery , that the Three Kings of Orient have arrived , and that is n't so , '' Rubalcaba said .

{"src": "CEDAR RAPIDS , Iowa — Officially , Mitt Romney returned to Iowa , the quadrennial presidential proving ground , to give a boost to Joni Ernst . But at a closed-door breakfast fundraiser here Monday , the first question from a donor had nothing to do with Ernst 's Senate campaign . `` When you get elected to the Senate , your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again , '' a donor told Ernst , according to several attendees . The Republican candidate said she would , while Romney laughed . When Romney and Ernst gathered in a West Des Moines boardroom with about 40 agriculture executives Sunday night , one businessman after another pleaded with Romney to give the White House another shot . And at a rally for Ernst in Cedar Rapids on Monday , the state legislator who introduced Romney said , `` If his address was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , I would sleep a lot better . '' After Romney and Ernst finished speaking , some activists chanted , `` Run , Mitt , run ! '' Romney , the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now the tacit head of the Republican Party , visited Iowa as part of a feverish nationwide tour designed to help the GOP take control of the Senate . He has insisted that he is not interested in running for president a third time . But his friends said a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity is nudging him to more seriously consider it . Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is hitting the stump for Republicans this fall -- which reminded us of some of his most memorable moments during the 2012 campaign . Here 's a look at some of Romney 's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right . ( Julie Percha/The Washington Post ) Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months . Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner , confidants said Romney is grappling with this question : If drafted , would he answer the party 's call ? Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D ) among likely Iowa voters , 44 percent to 43 percent . People in Romney 's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month 's midterm elections . Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty ( R ) , who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally , said he wants to see Romney give it another go . `` There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president , '' Pawlenty said . `` If he runs , I believe he could win the nomination and the general election . It 'd be the right person at the right time , and I would encourage him to do it . '' Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt `` and was stronger for it . '' In contrast with Romney , Pawlenty said , `` the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven . '' Within Romney 's political network , there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013 , according to people familiar with the discussions . It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year . Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail , and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4 . In Iowa , however , Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk . At the West Des Moines rally , he spoke for only five minutes , criticizing President Obama on income inequality , foreign affairs and other issues . When reporters tried to question him afterward , he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles . He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate , he had a joke to share involving Obama , golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi . As Romney told it , Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID . The teller asks him to prove who he is , saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target . `` Is there anything you can do to prove who you are ? '' the teller asks . `` I do n't have a clue , '' Obama replies in the joke . The crowd ate it up . Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care . But what really intrigues him , they said , are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field . If Romney moves toward a race , it would be because he sees a path to victory . `` It 's the market pulling him , '' said Kent Lucken , a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa . `` People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee , and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who 's been through the process . '' Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife , Ann , are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates . The event — to benefit neurological research at Brigham and Women 's Hospital — has Romney intimates abuzz . Save-the-date notices have gone out for the third annual Romney policy retreat in Park City , Utah , in June 2015 — a signal that he wants a platform to promote his issues as the presidential primary campaign season gets underway . Romney is also mingling privately with top donors who could fund a third campaign . Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts , a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC , at Ricketts 's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York . On Oct. 6 , Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson , the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman . Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors , while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch . At Johnson 's home , Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney 's political future . According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation , Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field . Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party 's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base 's embrace of ideological hard-liners . Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015 , should Sens . Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) or Ted Cruz ( R-Tex . ) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior . If former Florida governor Jeb Bush ( R ) opts out of a campaign , `` there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go , '' said Tom Rath , an influential New Hampshire Republican . At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue , `` people sat up and paid attention '' to Romney , said Sen. Johnny Isakson ( R-Ga. ) . `` I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming . He said he 's not running , and I take him at his word . But I do n't think the door is entirely closed , and circumstances can change . '' That phrase — `` circumstances can change '' — has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt . Spencer Zwick , Romney 's former national finance chairman , talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters . `` There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again , '' he said . Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle , including longtime advisers Beth Myers , Peter Flaherty , Stuart Stevens , Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip , who are advising Romney on political activities this fall . Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends : David Kochel , Ron Kaufman and Lucken . He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past . In Cedar Rapids , Romney spotted Jim Wilson , a Virginia man who logged more than 40,000 miles chasing the GOP nominee from coast to coast in his campaign-festooned GMC pickup . The two hugged . `` You son of a gun , '' Romney said . Another fan , Gary Chidester , 64 , came to the West Des Moines rally with a full coterie of Romney paraphernalia for the former candidate to autograph : campaign placards , enlarged photographs and buttons of Mitt and wife Ann , and paperback and audio copies of Romney 's book `` No Apology . '' He also held a framed drawing that a friend gave him of a black cruise ship named Obama sinking into the sea and a white ship named Romney with the caption , `` We 're here to save you . '' `` He 's the only qualified person to run this time , '' Chidester said . `` Mitt is a business genius . That 's why I 've listened to this tape three times . He had it all down — he had Russia down , he had the debt down — and all the other Republicans are novices by comparison .

{"src": "We need a study to tell us things like this ? My bad ; I forgot that society no longer has common sense . 6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment . The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart `` just stopped '' , and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call `` energy cocktails '' with friends the night before ( red bull and vodka ) . Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills , or cause anxiety disorders , IT CAN KILL YOU . PLEASE , everybody who reads this , remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX Why ? This trend has happened in the past too with other stimulants . Stimulants with depressants have a synergistic effect in some cases trippling the effect of one or the other which can have deadly consequences . The people using these combinations , one need to grow up and stop mixing drinks like little kids at a coolaid party and two wake up before they can not wake up ... they mix drinks for attention and some mystical edge that those flakes think they get from mixing energy drinks and alcohol ... .sad . Energy drinks are disgusting . Why would anyone mix them with alcohol ? When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up . Its a lot of fun , I had such good times in college , I miss it . We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers . That just made you kinda pass out and fall down , so not as much fun . I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up . I could start the process over when I woke up . I did this 5-6 nights a week on average . I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year . So there really isnt any harm in this behavior . Another misleading study . Forget that the people that drink energy drinks and alcohol together are just more riskier . Its the caffeine and alcohol combination that makes them morons . God forbid they are morons without the combination of the two . alcohol + energy drinks = a great time ! Alcohol must be necessary to cut the awful taste of the energy drinks . One major flaw in this study . Are the people who partake in this risky behaviour , including mixing caffiene and alcohol , more prone to this type of behaviour to begin with ? As a former `` cherry bomb '' , vodka-red bull , and jager-bomb drinker , I can appreciate the feeling you get when you drink caffiene and liquor . I never did anything extra risky when clubing and drinking these beverages . I also am not prone to risky behaviour other than the rare binge drinking . Gee what do you know ... more things that are bad for you ! ! What a bogus study . Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage . I for one love the combo but only in moderation . Risky behavior ... Give me a break ! Driving your car or even going to a party or club is `` risky '' behavior . With all the sickos in the world today , no one is ever safe . Always be aware of your surroundings and always in moderation . This article reminded me that I had a 5 hr energy drink in my computer bag . Thanks ! that just saved my afternoon . Also , I drank 2 – 5hr energies at a party last weekend and had a blast . Caffeine is what makes the world go round and alcohol makes the world a cooler place . So if my logic is correct the two combined are a match made in heaven . Drink on ! Red bull and vodka is the modern , legal , `` speedball , '' and we all know that caffeine + liquor simply equals a wide-awake drunk . So how is this riskier than just getting drunk and then trying to sober up by drinking black coffee ? I agree with everyone who says that vodka plus Red Bull is just legal crack . We might as well give up on the War on Drugs right now . It 's pointless to spend billions of dollars on fighting the cocaine cartels when you can just add vodka to Red Bull and get the same effect and the same damage to society from the perpetual overdoers . Nothing new – someone once thought it was 'fun ' to mix barbituates with stimulants . The fact remains , risk increases , not decreases . It 's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity , whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky . It usually begins with the phrase ' ... I like.. ' , as if the ends , the effect , justifies the means , the unknown mixture , regardless of the actual risks , usually unknown . Well , some people like pit bulls , some like shooting AK 's at wildlife , some like driving SUV 's like sports cars , but , none of those are conducive to low risk , great decisions or desirable behavior . The operative word here is MAY . This is not a definitive study and , therefore , any conclusions are not empirical . Two of the worst hangovers I have ever had were the result of just 2 or 3 vodka-redbulls ... No thanks , no more , that cured me . This indicates a link to Anxiety and Manic Depressive behavior . I used to drink energy drinks to help recover from the previous night . I then discovered that the energy drinks + alcohol were less expensive than plain energy drinks ( go figure ) . These became my first drinks of the day ... I am now in 12 step recovery . Who wants to live low risk their whole life ? The entire USA is a country of risk/pain/consequence averse cowards . Im surprised the Amish dont take over the country . They probably would if it werent for the language barrier . `` So there really is n't any harm in this behavior . '' – You 're an ignorant piece of trash , please die . Ok , enough with people being all judgmental and comparing redbull and vodka to a freaking SPEEDBALL of heroin and cocaine . Um , not even close people . How many of you out there take your doctor-prescribed anti-anxiety pills with your morning coffee ? Same thing . And to the person who said `` pit bulls ... [ not ] conducive to low risk , great decisions or desirable behavior '' I have a pitbull . They are VERY loving and loyal dogs . Even a poodle who is raised wrong can cause great injury to a person . I think it 's irresponsible to use owning a pitbull to try and make a point about reckless behavior . You are just spreading the hate . ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous . Sometimes I will have an energy beer , or do some various 'bomb ' containing redbull and something 80-proof . Obviously when you 're hyper and drunk , you might do stupid things . When you 're drunk and tired , you might also do stupid things . I wish doctors and researchers would find a cure for cancer and AIDS and stop 'researching ' all of these common sense things ! Ridiculous . I like to start the night off with a energydrink and vodka mix . one or two to get me going and then I switch to beer . I have been doing this for years and have not noticed any problems with health or risk taking . Taste Great , but yeah uppers + downers is a bad idea To Poppy , I think I went to college with you and was perhaps involved in the debauchery ... but do n't make nearly what you make , and not everyone is as lucky as you , or dodges as many life bullets as you have . word . I am sorry to read the post about the brother who passed away , possibly related to the mixture of energy drinks and alcohol . That being said , there is an old saying ... . '' everything in moderation '' PS – Red Bull and grape flavored Three Olives vodka is maaawney ! ! ! Patricia ... .Red Bull and vodka the same effect as cocaine ? you probably have had neither because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about Lester , redbull and vodka did n't make you an alcoholic , I guess you 've missed the step about taking responsibilitiy for your own actions . I 'm a professional , a mom and a wife who every once in a while ( about half a dozen times a year ) is called on by friends to go out and celebrate a special occassion . Unless I 'm at a party I do n't ever drink ( does n't entice me ) . Maybe as a product of my generation , I 've been drinking this combo for almost a decade . This study has no control for the initial propensity for risk that the individuals natrually possess . It certainly does n't make me more inclined to take any risks . What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am . Otherwise , I 'd pass out at 11pm ( toddlers really make you tired , no need to make a study for that ) . I do n't over-do it . Those who do would overdo it and take risks no matter what they were drinking . @ johnna : that 's absurd . If there is any truth to your post , then your brother most likely died because he had a congenital heart defect that may have been exacerbated by the caffeine and/or sugar in the energy drink . Glad to know that I only consumed a small qty of jagerbombs in my life – and never more than 1 in a single night . I no longer drink any sort of energy drink , they are just bad news all around . So ... . Vodka and Red Bull is bad , but an Irish Coffee is okay ? Huh . You need the alcohol mixers in order to drink the red bull – that stuff is just nasty – battery acid tasting . `` An acquired taste . '' Sorry , no thanks . Moderation is key . Binge drinking is just plain stupid . When you have college students who think they will live forever , try to drink a keg themselves , or a liter of Jack Daniels at one sitting or ... your self-prescribed alcohol mix here ... then you will have problems . Yes , first time binge drinkers can die . Yes , some alcoholic drinkers can drink all they way all the time and nothing `` serious '' happens to them , yet others imitating them can die . George Burns drank and smoke cigars til he died . Thousands of others imitating his kind of lifestyle died much sooner . We may never know what kept him from having problems . I do n't drink , but if I did , I 'd have an XS Energy Drink and some good vodka . 14 flavors , little caffiene ( 6 oz coffee amt ) but 5000 % Vitamin B12 . Yes , it could make a more awake drunk . But you could also drink the XS Energy without the booze and not have a sugar crash later . Because it does n't have any sugar or carbs in it . Only 8 calories a can . And no acquired taste for battery acid required . www . jve . biz pwd : nutrition Most of these posts scare me to death for today 's generation . I hope there are n't many out there like you . My preference is Tequila Bombs or Watermelon Crawls ... .a shot of tequila surrounded by the energy drink or 1/2 shot tequila and 1/2 shot watermelon pucker surrounded by energy drink . I usually drink about 12 of these on a `` party '' night . Feel real good all night and never feel sick the next day if I stop at 12 . Anything after 12 can take a turn for the worse ! This is news ? 30 years ago , it was caffiene tablets from the back of High Times and power drinking . 20 years ago , it was speed and power drinking . 10 years ago , energy drinks came on the scene and power drinkers have made the transition official . Now we have a study that advises if you give caffiene or other herbal stimulants to a power-drinker , then you get a wide-awake drunk . I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew . Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior ? DUH ... . Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations ? again , DUH ... . The more things change , the more they remain the same . What a ridiculous study . It 's sad that people even consider this news . There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull . I agree that some of the larger energy drinks , like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine ... .but mixing it with alcohol is n't the problem . It 's the alcohol ! People have been mixing liquor with coca cola and coffee forever and this is no different . Caffeine and alcohol ? Who would have *ever* thought of mixing those two ? Anyone ever heard of `` Rum & Coke '' before ? And to the people who are equating mixing alcohol and energy drinks to cocaine , wow , you could not be more wrong . It is not even close to the same thing . Not even a little bit . Hopefully they people get anxiety and depression and kill themselves before they cost all of money in the free health care they will require and get ! Let 's all be idiots and then make everyone else pay the price . BRILLIANT ! ! ! ! Kids that are 25 and younger in this country are absolutely useless anyway . Hopefully they wipe themselves out and we jump right to next generation . Afterall , it is the same people that have worshiped Britany Spears , Paris Hilton , The Hills , and energy drinks . I think we will be ok if they all end up in mental hospitals or dead . Risky behavior ? I would think that 's the least of your concerns when your mixing uppers and downers . I feel like we might see the effects of those nasty drinks in studies done years from now on my peers that party hard . Eating a healthy diet , exercise and proper breathing also gives you energy ... all day long ! Huh ... .I would think the mix would leave you with one heck of a hang over . The kind that feels like a spike in your brain . @ Poppy : diaf pls . k , thnx @ the rest of you : Chill out . You all are like watching people run around in circles pulling their hair out in a mad panic . omg omg this is hooooorible . We must lemming march and listen to these wise souls who tell us their correlational study is the gospel truth ! Alcohol has been a source of risky behavior since the dawn of , well , liquor . I do n't think adding a Red Bull or a Monster is going to make that any less true . I really get annoyed when people leave comments just to say , `` This is n't news ! '' People need to be reminded once in a while if something is n't a good idea . A lot of people mix energy drinks with alcohol . As for myself , usually consume my energy drink an hour or so before beginning a night out to shake off a mood , a feeling of sloth . So maybe my timing is OK ? I have n't noticed anything too unusual when I do this . It is wise to remember `` everything in moderation '' , as someone above said . It is common sense , but how many of of really practice that ? `` Woolsey says the danger is n't specifically in the caffeine ; it 's in the combination of drinks with the other stimulants potentially being more dangerous because people have n't built up tolerances to them . Woolsey says many of these so called energy drinks contain unregulated herbal stimulants . '' Did all of you totally miss this part ? You all keep going on about the caffeine . Read a story in its entirety , dont lock on one thing and run with it like a 5 year old . More junk `` science '' used to create sensational headlines . College kids do crazy stuff , they always have and always will . Unfortunately some of us will not live through it . There seems to be a lot of people in denial here .

{"src": "If only it were the worst thing that a Roman Catholic priest has been caught doing . The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev . Alberto Cutié , the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows , cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman . Over a three-day period , the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar . In one of TVnotas 's `` in fragranti '' shots [ Note to TVnotas copy editors : it 's `` in flagrante '' ] the woman wraps her legs around Cutié ; in another , Cutié has a hand down her swimsuit , fondling her rear end . Because of the scandal , the Archdiocese of Miami says Cutié , 40 , is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish , and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there . His media work seems up in the air now , and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cutié asking forgiveness . ( See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America . ) Most Catholics probably do n't approve of CutiÃ© 's affair . Still , will they back the archdiocese ? CutiÃ© 's punishment is understandable at first glance , at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy . To the Catholic Church , priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church — the `` bride of Christ . '' In a statement , Miami Archbishop John Favalora said CutiÃ© 's actions `` can not be condoned despite the good work he 's done as a priest . '' ( See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building . ) But Cutie 's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse , parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance . The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years — including a case involving a former priest at CutiÃ© 's South Beach church , St. Francis de Sales . ( One of CutiÃ© 's tasks , in fact , has been to heal the wounds inside that parish . ) To his credit , Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church . But so long as CutiÃ© was n't frolicking with a minor ( female or male ) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour , many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent . ( Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican . ) What 's more , one of the pillars of CutiÃ© 's popularity is his relationship counseling . To any Catholic who 's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary , CutiÃ© 's romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest — more human , perhaps , than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees , gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church 's litany of `` non-negotiable '' rules . `` He was doing this fairly out in the open , '' notes one Miami Catholic who knows CutiÃ© well and has undergone marriage counseling with him . `` Most priests who do this usually try to hide it , but this was n't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence . It does n't appear to be just about sex ; it 's about intimacy , and he 's always been able to help people understand which is more important . '' The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to CutiÃ© is n't surprising , either . CutiÃ© 's last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY , but that has n't stopped people from calling the handsome , telegenic priest `` Father Cutie '' — the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname `` Father What-a-Waste . '' In 1999 , when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network , Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto ( Change Your Life With Father Alberto ) , he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is `` a struggle , but it 's a good struggle . '' It was a battle that CutiÃ© was perhaps destined to lose , not just because of his good looks but his celebrity . In the chaste , pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s , no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend . But today , the temptations for an attractive media star , ordained or not , are greater — especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach . And CutiÃ© was never a shy altar boy to begin with . Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents , he was a popular deejay as a teen , and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym . That 's not to say , however , that Cutié is a liberal priest . His current television talk show , Hablando Con Padre Alberto ( Talking With Father Alberto ) , is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN ( Eternal World Television Network ) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun , Mother Angelica . Last December he blasted Playboy 's Mexican edition for what he called a `` blasphemous '' cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary . On his shows on the Radio Paz ( Radio Peace ) network , and in his columns and books , such as Ama de Verdad , Vive de Verdad ( Real Love , Real Life ) , Cutié usually toes the Vatican 's doctrinal line on issues like abortion . Nonetheless , the CutiÃ© scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church , a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality . ( See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo , who has admitted to fathering a child , and is alleged to have sired others , while he was still a priest . ) A bigger problem for the Church , however , may be CutiÃ© 's Oprah-like standing in the Latino community — the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth . America 's Catholic bishops , many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen , must realize that CutiÃ© is more well regarded among Catholics than they are , especially among Latinos , meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest 's future with special care . For his part , Cutié said in his statement that `` the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact , '' a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood . Regardless , Cutié 's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest , and the Church , need to recognize `` that there 's another human being involved in this , the woman in the pictures , and if they 're not sensitive to her as well they 're looking at double the scandal . '' In his statement , Favalora said , `` Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments . '' He 's right ; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church . And while they may not applaud Cutié for tasting forbidden fruit , they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either .", "ref_summs": "The Archdiocese of Miami punishes an ultra-popular prelate after a tabloid publishes pictures of him cavorting with a woman", "sys_summs": {"lede3": {"sys_summ": "If only it were the worst thing that a Roman Catholic priest has been caught doing .
