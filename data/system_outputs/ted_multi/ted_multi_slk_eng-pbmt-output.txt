By the end of this year will be on this planet about billion people to use active aspects of social networks .
The only thing that they have in common is that all die .
Even when it can be a bit of a morbidn thought , I think that there 's seriously impacts that it 's explore .
And this idea of me by the first time this year blog from Derek K. Miller , scientific and technological journalist , who died at cancer .
And Miller to give his family and known to wrote a contribution , who was published soon after he died .
This wrote intro .
" He said , " " So it 's here . I 'm dead , and this is my last a blog posts . "
"head I asked to when my body finally get rid of weeks way cancer , to my family and friends published this setoven message — as the first part process for creating that active page on archive . " " As a journalist , I loveler archive was probably thewritten better and doed attention than others , but the point is that we 're all today we 're creating archives , who 's something completely else than whatever was created itktor of the previous generation . "
Think about a few statistics .
Right now , every single one minute , it 's 48 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube .
Every day you send 200 million tweets .
And the average user Facebook create 90 pieces content every month .
When you think of their parents and old parents , at its best , could create a few photos or home video or a journal , who 's surviving somewhere in a box .
But today , we 're creating all this incredibly rich digital archive that survives in cloud permissionless , years after , as we 're gone .
And I think this create some very novel possibilities for technologists .
For clar , " " I 'm a journalist , I , not technology , so I from just run together wanted to lay down as will be present and future look like .
I see some services that allow us to make things decided , what happens with our online profiles and the contas social media after our death .
One of them , pretty bottom , she found me , when I was a school in la-s in a restaurant in New York at The Foursquare .
( Anast ) Adam Ostro : " " hello .
Death : Adam ?
Adam Ostrow : Yeah .
Death : Death you can described anywhere , any time , even the organic food .
Adam Ostro : " " Who 's that ?
Death , " " Just in the fidie — (aks die .net ) than it 's too late . (Ko with recordings . )
( Laughter ) It 's a bit frightening , right ?
This a service you fairly simply enable us to create a message or video that can send on Facebook , when you die .
Another current a service called 1,000 Memors (spo of ) .
It enables you to create online memory of for your loved ones , completely with the images , video and stories that can publishing to when you die .
But I think that it 's what comes next , that 's much more interesting .
It 's probably know over Deb Ros that in March this year showed , as was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours home video .
I think that , as the ability to understand the human machine language and process large volumes data continue improving , is going to be possible to analyze the content of all life — tweets , photos , and videos , blogs — which produces in so massive volumes .
And I think , when it happens , it 's possible for our digital " " greats " " continues in interactions with real world long after , as we walk out , and that 's thanks to massive lot of content who we 're creating and ability of technology 's all understand .
Now today , we 're beginning to see some of the experiments .
The service We Next , a Tweet ( 's my next tweet ) and analyze it your Twitter roofam — everything you sent on Twitter , to predict what you could say on .
Well , now as you can see , they 're results a little bitsic .
You can but imagine something like this about five , 10 or 20 years , with of improving our technical ability .
And it 's move even further , media lab MIT working on robots that can interact more human .
But what if these robots knew interact based on unique traits a specific person based on hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that that person produced my life ?
Finally , remember the Go famous scene election night 2008 in the United States , where CNNslo living a hologram hip hop- artist will . .am of their study for interviews with Anderson Cooper .
What if we were able to use that sort of technology tos our missed into our habits and interact in very vivid form based on everything content who we 've created in life ?
I think that 's going to happen really possible because volume data that we 're using and technological options for their understanding is growing exponentially .
Finally , I think that we need to think about whether we want this was our reality — , and if it does , what does this mean for definition of life and everything what comes next .
Thank you very much !

Today , I 'm going to talk to you about of an unexpected discovers .
I 'm working in solar-e industry .
My little newza business is us trying to bring the care about the environment , and it 's so ...
... and it 's so that we 're using options crowd-sourcing .
It 's just so short video of what we 're doing .
Heh . Hang a sec .
It can take time , until it triggers .
( Laughter ) We can — we can kind of leapfrog — Well 's a video just for arresteds — ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not a — ( Laughter )
It 's okay . ( Laughter )
Theolry technology 's ...
So my time 's up ?
Okay , well . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
The second is from head
And the answer is sadly yes .
Then you can do predictions and testing them .
What about complex systems we know ?
So the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
Where are economic networks ?
We we focus on networks property .
Companies we grade
How are they arrangement ? They 're isolated ?
They 're society acting in multiple countries and we found them 43,000 .
I 'll explain it in this example .
Hi . Today together on around us into my about eight projects that I made in conjunction with the Danish artist Soren of Pors .
We 're talking ' Pors & Rao and we live and work in India .
" That sounds my first subject that I call " " My uncle-telephone . " " It was inspired by strange habit of my strings kept asking me to him something did , almost as if I was an extension of his body — so I turned out the lights , brought in a glass of water or crab cigarettes . "
And as I 've been growing , it 's still worse and worse , and I started to perceive it as a form of control .
But of course , I 've never couldn 't say nothing , because uncle is respected person in India family .
And what I most annoying and what 's , I don 't understand was the way using phone .
He kept head from me and expected , " I 'm going to videos number .
" So response to it and as a gift for mybin " " I told him , made a " " My uncle-telephone . " " It 's so long that it 's needed to operatored two people . "
It 's aptly right on how my uncle us phone designed for one person .
But the problem is that when she left out of home , and I went to college , started me uncleve theanding miss .
And so I made a unique writinging machine , which could commands making their sonscom , and it 's around the world in the form of email .
So had to take paper to develop a it on the cylinder , writes email or command and pull paper out .
This device automatically sent letter demanded person like email .
So here you can see that we 've spent a lot of electronics that understanding all of the mechanicalon , and doing them in digital .
So my uncle works only with mechanical interface designed .
And of course , this object needs to be big and have in yourself a modicum of ofism , like my uncle has like .
" The next piece is an installation sensitive to the sound that 's kindly we call " " " Pygmies . " " And we wanted to work with idea that we 're surrounded by tribes very shy , sensitive and cutss . "
And it 's so that we have a wall these panels and to them , are this creatures .
As long as it 's silence , so like this , they climb up onto .
If there 's still quieter , so they are corks .
And the slightest sound youed again the hidden .
These panels we had on three walls room .
We hide themed more than 500 of these small pygms .
It 's like this .
This is video prototype .
When it 's silence , so slowly coming out from behind panels .
And they 're hearing as people or as animals creatures .
So after a while they becomesnnys on the sounds that their desia .
And we don 't sensitive to the sounds in the background .
You 're going to hear the train that they don 't respond .
(H noise ) But respond to the sounds in the foreground . " " moment that you hear .
( Whistling ) So we worked hard to created them what the most natural .
Every pygm has own behavior , psychology , which mood swings , personality and so forth .
This is a very wounded prototype .
Of course , it 's then much improved .
And we made them to respond at people , but we found that people with them like to play .
" This is a video an installation called " " called person . " " Dness interested playing the idea of unseenity . "
What would it be like to be experience unseenity ?
So , we worked with society that specializes in cameras secure and asked them to develop software with us , using cameras that would looked at people in the room , one person and watched them replaced the background , what would cause her unseenity .
I 'll show you very with a prototype .
You can see , on the right my colleague Sorena that is really in space .
And on the left you see processed video , where it camera of invisibl .
Weren 's in the room . Hop ! " " And it 's invisible .
So you can see that it 's watching and me cameras .
It 's very early video , so we haven 't solveding and everything about it , but that 's then improveed quite quickly .
We used it in a room where the camera looked into space and on each wall we had one screen .
And when people walked into a room , you see on the screen , with one difference : one person was still invisible , let 's anywhere moving the room .
" This is a work called " " song , the Sun . " " And it 's almost like a sheet of paper , the papercut as a pediatric drawings of oil 's spots or sun . "
Thehead this object of seem very powerful and bu real and from the side from seem very weak .
So people walked into a room and almost it ignored , thinking , that it 's some garbage , what 's to be off .
But once they 've gone around , began 's marketing with climb to the wall .
And it 's they weren 't and they back down .
( Laughter ) So this work is cartoon of flipped a man .
Its head is so hard , full of tough ideas that kind of fell down into his hat and his body of him grow up almost like a plant .
And it does that that moves around very monkey these actinging way to my head , very unprecedented and extremely slow motion .
And it 's as if it 's restricted this circles .
Because if there wasn 't this circle , and underedha would be very equals , theulate around the space .
There 's no wires .
Let me show you an example of — so when people enter into room , activate this object .
And a few minutes , very slowly , it 's so with the effort of person climbs up , and then it starts going on , and it looks like it 's every moment had to fall .
This is a very important moment , because we wanted to viewer impact instinct almost to go and help or save this object .
But it actually doesn 't need because he again can somehow pull up .
So this work was for us a real the next challenge , and worked very hard on it as the most our work for years to the mechanics , the balance and dynamics work right .
It was very important for us to make that moment , when it 's nearly parachute , because if we do so that would for what was designedibility , could do it , and if it didn 't , we don 't enough , it would it the falism or that feeling of want to go and helping that .
I 'll show you very short video , where we 're doing trial — it 's much faster .
That 's my colleague . P did it .
Now it be nervous , so it 's going to catch .
But you have to , because it wasn 't be able to pick up .
This is the work of where we 've been very interested by working with aesthetics skin , which you put thousands of tiny fiber optic strands different sizes that glow like for the night sky .
And it 's so dimensions that it looked like for the night sky .
They 's about as we dropsed forms , that 's in the form of teddy bear that there was from the ceiling .
And the idea was sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract , as the universe is to something that 's very well known , like the honey says , which is very , very comforting and close .
And it 's us about that at some point , you stop look to the shape of the teddy bear , and you start to perceive it as a hole in space and like you 're looking at the glowing night sky .
" This is the last job , which still does , and this is called " " space has a block . " " Imagine a little cube that 's about this big , standing in front of you in the middle of the room and when to it closer , you 're trying to scaring by grow on the cubes , that 's twice as high and has four times so volume . "
This object is constantly expand in its to created the dynamics with people around ; it around — almost like in yourself was trying to hide secret or something like that .
So we 're working with a lot of technology , even though we don 't like technology very we don 't have , because with it in our works years we care about .
But we use it because we are interested in the way that we can help us express emotions and behavior in these creatures that we 're creating .
And as soon as us some creation mind , it 's almost as if process creature , to find the way that wants this creature be and form that want to have and the way they want to move around .
Thank you !

I love the Internet .
It 's true .
Think about everything bring us .
Think of all the services that we use all the connection , all here fun , all business , all sale .
And that 's happening in our lives .
I 'm sure that one day , we 're going to writeys , hundreds of years from now . " " And then our generation will be generation that became online , generation that built something really and truly global .
But yeah , it 's also true that the Internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with problems with security and privacy .
I 've spent my career as struggle with these issues .
Let me show you something here .
This is a Brain .
This is a disketa — five and neighborhood-ins disketa infected by a viruses Brain And .
It 's the first virus that we found for personal computers .
And we know where Brain came .
We know that , because it 's written in the code .
Let 's look .
It 's okay .
" This is Godot sector infected disks . And if you look closer , we see right here says that " " Welcome to cave . " " And it 's go sayc 1986 , Bast and Amyad . "
Bast and Amyad are names , names of Pakistan .
In fact , there 's phone number and address in Pakistan .
( Laughter ) Well , a year 1986 .
Now is the world in 2011 .
That 's 25 years .
The problem computer viruses has 25 years .
A a half years ago , I decided to go to Pakistan .
Let 's see , here 's a few photos from my stay in Pakistan .
This is a town Lahore that 's about 300 miles south of Abbotttdbu , where we grab Bin Laden .
This is a typical street .
And here 's a street if the leader of the journey to this building , what 's 730 Nizam block in Aldma Iqbal .
I was Zaked on the door .
( Laughter ) Want to guess who open doors ?
Bast and Amyad ; they 're still there .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) That what cost is Bast .
The sitting is his brother Amyad .
These are the guys who they wrote the first computer virus .
We 're , of course , a very interesting debate .
We asked why .
We asked feeling of what to start .
And so I 'm a little , when I found out that even Bast and Adm had infected their computers numerous times completely unknowns other viruses during those years .
So it 's yet same justice in the world .
The viruss that we 'dy invited in the ' 80s and ' 90s — are not the problem .
So let me show you a few examples like used to look like .
That 's what 's the desertam 's the system that makes me launching ancient y programs to modern computer .
You add some discs . Sem .
Here we have a list of old viruses .
So I run a few viruses on my computer .
For example , let 's first at Thetipeade ( Snores ) .
And you can see on the top of the screen , a hundredd running through your computer when infects this .
You know that you were infected , because it 's show .
Here 's another one . This is a virus Cash (Pd ) from Russia , 1992 .
Let me show you one that makes a sound .
" (H noises ) And the last example , guess what makes virus Walker (C agreementing ) .
Yes , there 's pan kid walking on through screen when you infects .
So it 's formerly easy to know that you 're infecting inirus , when he was writing viruses hobby and back and teenagers .
Today they 're not written andmatters and teenagers .
Today , they are viruses a global problem .
That 's what we have in the background is an example of our system , which runs in our labs where we watch virusk infections in the world .
We can see the real time that we 're turning viruses from Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and otherelig .
In fact , when I put back into our system over the Web we can see in real time demonstration of how much viruses , how many new examples harmful programs we 're finding every day .
Here 's newest virus that we found in the collection of Server . Sex .
We found it , right here three seconds — the previous , six seconds .
And when it 's walking , it 's just massive .
We 're even tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of .
And that 's the last 20 minutes harmful programs (alwaru ) , every single day .
So where all come ?
Well , today it 's organized criminal group (gangs ) who are writing these viruses , because they got paid .
It 's groups like — let 's go to the GangtBucks.com.
It 's web at work in Moscow , where these people they infected computers .
So when you virus authors and you 're able to infecting computers with Windows , but you don 't then what with them , you can 't sell — someone else 's computers — these people .
And they you really will pay money for the computers .
And as they then & these infected computers ?
Well , it 's more ways of like banking the soyish a horse that steal money from your online bank accounts , when you 're using online graing , or theylogagery .
Keylogger quiet sitting in your computer , and tracked everything you .
You sit for your computer , and you 're looking for Google .
Each one finding that you write a is recorded and send bited criminals .
Each one email that you write a is enrolled and sent criminals .
The same is true for every battle cry , and so on .
But that 's what it 's the most to them , they 're for s sitting — withesisions ) when you 're online and online you 're shopping in some online store .
So6 when you 're shopping online , you 're writing your name , address delivering , number in your paytime cards and safety code paytime cards .
And here 's an example of file that we find here on the server a couple of weeks ago .
This is a number platetime cards , the date expration , a security code , and this is the name owns of cards .
And once you 'll get access to information about other people 's card , you can online to buy whatever you want with these data .
And obviously , it 's the problem .
They 're here for black markets in underworld , a business-1 ecosystem around online crime .
One example than are these people able toize their operation . Let 's go and look at page INTERPOL and let us look looked person .
We 'll find people if Bjorn Sunsin , origins from Sweden , and his partner in crime , also list looked INTERPOL , Mr. Shaileshcumar Jin , sometimes the United States .
These two controlled the operation called I.M.U . , of cybercedined surgery , which to earned millions .
Both of them are in to escape .
No one know where they are .
Americanpany , just a couple of weeks ago frozen Swiss bank account belongs to Mr. Jin and the account featured 14.9 million dollars .
So volume money that generates online crime is great .
And what that means is that online criminaly can afford to invest in their attacks .
We know that online criminaly hire programmers , the hire tests , testing their code , have their systems with SQL databases .
" And they can afford to watch as we 're working — we humans from security — and trying to find a way of security around every steps that we come up with .
They use also global nature of the Internet to his advantage .
Because the Internet is an international .
That 's why is called the Internet .
And when you look at what is happening in online world , here 's the video from Clarified Networks that illustrates how one group working in the pestm software could move around the world .
This operation , the assumption origins has in Estonia , is moving from one country to the other right attempting to turning their pages .
These people just doesn 't be to turn out .
We leap from one country to the other , from one jurisduction into another — carrying the world , using fact , we don 't have the opportunity to global with the operations like this .
The Internet is like if someone put loose tickets all online criminals of the world .
Thes who didn 't know before to us , by the time they get to us .
So actually how can we look for online criminals ?
How can you actually can .
Let me give you an example .
Here we have one file on the use of security hole — exploit .
I look at the hexyps image of file , which contains exploit .
That actually means that when you look at this image on your computer with Windows , for take 's your computer and ignites code .
When you look at this images file — that 's a screens the and here begins own code attack .
And that code was encrypted you cut , so wept .
He used to ad function XOR 97 .
You have to trust me , that 's just , it 's so .
We can go back and start to decipher .
The yellow parts code are now decrypted .
And I know that 's doesn 't look very different from the original .
But just look at this watch .
Here you 'll see down web address theonsec.com / d / yo . " " And when , open up this picture on your computer he actually download and ignites the program .
" It 's " " back in " " — security tissues flaw , which makes forr 's your computer . "
But what 's more interesting is when we 're continuing in the decoding , find this mysterious chain , O600KO78RUS .
The code is under encrypt as some signature .
It didn 't use it for anything .
As I was looking at it , I 've tried to figure out what that means .
I googed to it .
zero results ; it wasn 't there .
So I 've talked about with people with the lab .
We have to us a few Russ and one of them say , well , ends at " "rus " " like Russia .
And 78 " " " " is code city , city S . Petohra .
You can find , for example , in and phone numbers , brands cars and so forth .
So I was out looking for contacts in S . St. Peters . And after long journey we finally got to this one website .
It 's this Russ , who 's the online for a few years , it 's own website , and from the popular blogging Live Journal .
And on this blog blogging about my life , about my life in with . " "Pet-grade — has something through 20 — about his cat , about his friend .
And it has a very nice car .
This youngster rides his Merceades-Benz S600 In12 with six-liters the engine and more than 400 horses .
That 's really nice car to 20-some-year-old from S . Petoh .
How do I know about that car ?
Because of his blogging .
He was actually even accident .
In the center . Peter Sohra , on with their car to another car .
And he gave on a blog images this accidents — that 's his Merceades — that 's a Lad Samr theya .
And you can see that the brand the Samars ends at 78RUS .
And when we look at an image of all scenes , you can see that the brand Merceades is O600KO78RUS .
" I 'm a lawyer , but if I was him was , here I said , " " the idea is clear . " " ( Laughter ) What actually happens when the online criminal sed ? "
Well , that 's most cases as far it gets .
So , most of the time online crime we don 't know , it 's not a continent , from which those attacks are coming .
And even when we find criminals , quite often of that eventually nothing isn 't .
And the police department of uncon , or , if you do , it 's not enough evidence , or from some reasons we can 't to them off .
I wish that was easier ; unfortunately it 's not .
But things are changing in very high rate .
You 've heard things like Studxnet .
If you look at what did Studxnet , infected this .
That 's Semens S7-400 PLC , programmable a logical control units .
And that 's what 's moving our infrastructure .
That 's moving all around us .
PLC , these little flew plagues that don 't have display , or the keyboard , are programmed , stored on place and there they do their job .
For example , elevators in this building are probably controlled something like that .
And when Studxnet compromised some of them , it 's massiven revolution in kind ofs the risk of that we need to care .
Because all around us is them controlled .
I think on critical infrastructure .
You go to factories , power plant , chemical plant , processing plant food , look — everything starts to be controlled computers .
All the computers .
It relies on that the computers work .
This , we are very hookeds on the Internet , on the basic things like aelecina , obviously , as the work of computers .
And it 's something that for us creates completely new problems .
We 've got to have some way continuing at work even when computers fail .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Prepaveness means that we can do things even when things that we take it for granted there won 't .
It 's actually very about the basis — to think about continuite , about-hing , about the things that really matter .
I 'll tell you — ( Laughter ) I love the Internet . I really .
Think of all the services that they 're available online .
Think about it , if you wereing , if you 're their one day just didn 't have , for some reason .
I see beauty in the the future of the Internet , but I 'm afraid that 's don 't see .
So I 'm afraid that we 're having problems with online crime .
Online crime 's one thing that 's us these things can take .
( Laughter ) I 've spent my life to defending the Internet . " " And really I feel that , if we don 't fight with online crime , we run the risk of everything that 's lost .
We have to do global , and we need to do right now .
What we need is more global , international toriminalist work looking for gangs online crime — these organized gangs making on their attacks millions .
That 's much more important than use anti-retrovirals and frewall .
And what really matter , is to find people behind these attacks . And more importantly , we have to find people who are becoming part of this the world online crime , but even him are not .
We have to find the people with the skills , but without opportunities and give them those opportunities , to use their abilitys act good .
Thank you very much .

I want to start by telling you , I 'll offer , and in fact , what you have to do is , we at two minutes change your attitude .
But before it 's you that I 'm going to ask you to checked their body , and it 's what you do with it .
How many of you are kind of them ?
Sometimes that 's how we 're holding hands .
Sometimes we 're expanding this . " " ( Laughter ) I see you . ( Laughter )
So I want you to now attention to what you 're doing .
We 're fascinated language body and particularly interest
You know , we 're interested in us , so , you know — ( Laughter ) — within 's an interaction , or smile , flocking sight , or maybe very weird to stiring condition , or even something like undering hands .
The commentator : That 's is approaching to Dom number 10 and look ,
Even for BBC and The New York Times .
So of course , when we think about the non-verbal behavior , or body language — but as sociologists we 're talking nonverbal — it 's speech , so we 'll have in mind communication .
If we have a mind communication , we think of interactions .
It 's a lot of reasons why to believe that this is the correct
And based on body language you have a lot of opinions and the conclusions .
These judgments can predict really meaningful the results , as who to or position we , who we 'll phone on a date .
For example , Andni Andmbady , researchs at the University of Herephts illuminate that when people watching without sound 30-second clips a clips real interactions between physician and patients their opinions to likness doctor predicting weight , or the doctor 's going to be or not be sued .
If you use them wrong , it 's worse .
We 're our non-verbalm speech , also influenced by our thoughts , feelings , even our physiology .
And you don 'tverbal gesture , I 'm saying ?
I 'm sociologist . I study biases and teaching on a business school with competition of atmosphere , so you don 't avoided to started interested in the dynamics of power .
And I was interested in a particularly about nonverbal manifestations of power and dominance .
What are the non-verbal manifestations of power and dominance ?
In realms animals it 's expanding .
Any time you 're big , pulling in , you 're in space , essentially open .
It 's about taking . " " And this is true in all of
This speech , which became known as the pride , studied Jessica Tracy It shows that .
The our . We don 't want to hit the person next to us .
And this is what happens when you merge a big
So when it 's somebody in a us very powerful , we tend it shrink the . , we don 't the same thing , what they .
I 'm observe this behavior in class , and what I noticed ? " " And I noticed that the students MBA
When they become established , so like will spread .
And then you have other people who are basically s , when they 're going . You see that now , like they 're going .
In this , I saw a couple of things .
It 's much more likely to do something that the women , not men .
Women are long term feel less powerful than men , so it 's not a surprise . But there 's another thing that I 've noticed is , " "
This is in the classroom MBA very important , because the activity on hundreds of hours of creating half grades .
Business schools struggle with this gulf between the grade of both sexes in the same individual .
So I started thinking about it . " " Do you have that all these people .
Well , there are some evidence .
For example , we 're smiling , when we 're happy , but also , if we 're making to smile , by holding pen like this between teeth , causes that feel happier .
So it 's a two-wayed . And with the power of " "
The second question was , " " — we know that our minds are changing our bodies — but is true that our bodies are changing our minds ?
And when I say minds in the case of power , actually I 'm talking about ?
What do they look like mind powerful versus think " "
People with power tend to be , not surprisingly , andset and robust , more optimistic .
They have a feeling that you play in the gambled games .
So there 's a lot of the differences . That 's risk .
But in fact , it 's power 's also about how you respond to stress .
You are somebody who wants impacted a leader , who is dominant , has a high testosterone , but strongly under a stress ?
You probably don 't , right ? You want person ,
So we have both evidence . So that the body can shape mind , at least at the level of the faces , and it 's that change role can shape mind .
So what happens , if you let 's to a new role , what happens if you do to really at least level , like this tiny manipulation , like this tiny intervention around ?
Here 's some others .
So you can stand or even sitting .
Here 's attitudes signaling a little power .
They 're , you 're doing is small .
When you touch the neck ,
So it 's like this . " " The ,
That was it . That was the experiment .
The testosterone , we discovered this .
So again , two minutes , and you can get these changes .
" The cortisol , this happens . People traineding " " might " " attitudes . " "
It seems so that our non-verbal manifestations of control it , so it 's not just the seconds , but also us .
It also our bodies are changing our minds .
We think that this particularly as you could use it are social situation rating . Where you value
Again , this is not about , like you speak for other people .
It 's talking to myself . " " What you 're doing before ,
So that 's what we wanted to test this .
It took five minutes . On playing them .
" Five minutes , and it 's nothing worse than if they 're disturbing you .
People hate it . It 's something that Marianne Lans called " "
" Then he looked at those recording four code . " "
I don 't recognize hypothesis . Don 't recognize conditions .
It 's about performing that to put into speech .
These things . People bringing their true self .
So this leads the effect , or communicate the effect .
So say to them , " " pretend it 's , until it can 't — like " " And I 'm not .
I don 't want to prove it and still to have a sense that it 's fraud .
I don 't want to feel as a fraud .
When I was 19 , survived I 'm very hard in a car accident , .
It happened me out of the car and did I some thermel .
It happened me out of the car . " " I woke up in the rehab facility
I knew their IQ , because I was considered a smart and for overed child .
So I 've had from college and she was trying to go back .
" They said to me , " "s college completed . "
I 'm a fraud .
Will it remain you and you made idea .
" " " I mean , the fact that I 'm doing . " " " " So I did . " " Five years graduate studied , " "
It 's not feel , but she yes , and I know what it is .
It 's pretend it 's , it can happen .
So it 's changed .
I want to mean to say , don 't fake it 's , until only you can 't .
You fake it until it 's what happens . Okay ?
Rob it until it 's really going to happen .
The last thing I 'm going to tell you is this .
Now , this idea of marginal raisestas can lead to a big change to happen .
These are two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
This should you do . Inconfiguring your brain ,
They think of testosterone . It 's cortisol .
Theyp of , so you of that situation leaving with feelings , you don 't show them their true self .
Thank you . ( Applause )
The big creativity . In the time a we need a lot of creativity .
Dilandty . U. creativity is amazingly , absurd , rationally and irrationally strong .
The big creativity can spread tolerance , double freedom , to make education something like a great idea .
( Laughter ) So the big creativity can turning attention to dejection , or to show that deptation is not in place .
The big creativity can do a politicianse orn side unthinkable .
Can you paint it war like tragedy or a .
Creativity is the mimic that she 's onshirt slogans and phrases into our mouths .
Creativity is the pioneer that shows us a simple journey doesn 'testuped moral blue center .
Science is smart , but big creativity is something less oftch , the more magical . And now need absolutely magical .
It 's time .
Our climate change quickly , too quickly .
And a big creativity is needed to make , which makes as well : to inspired different thinking with dramatic , creative works statements .
And to guide us from other acting that is going to be full of pleasantly creative tiny .
Here 's one more creative tinyness created of initiative , which I involved that tries to help creativity inspire people to were ecologicaler .
( Video ) Man : You know , rather than a car , I 'll go today on the paths .
Narrator : " " And so he went , and when he went , saw things .
The weird and wonderful things that would otherwise seen this before .
It 's room crib where leg . Theing motocskel .
It 's and daughter separated from the bicycle secrete wall .
And then stopped . She walked in front of him . "
Woman that with him as a child jump through field and broke his heart .
" Sure , since aboutstared a little bit .
In fact , fromstard enough .
But he 's starting to all my old passion for her . "
" " Ford " " said silence . That was her name . "
" " " don 't speak a word , Guists said . " " That was his name . "
" " I about what happens next to carvan , exactly 300 feet from here .
" Let 's love . " " In " " Ford z running . We ran one leg , and then the other . "
Guests into it hard entered and loveded with rhythmically , while she filmed because she wasr andmatter 's porn- photographs .
Earth is sex for them both .
And they lived together happily ever after .
And it 's all because decided to go in the day on the paths .
( Applause ) Andes Hobsbaw : We have science , we had already debate .
Moral thempertive 's on the table .
The big creativity is required to take everything 's the kicker and did it simple and . " " happiness " "
And for all came together . To inspired the people to people wanted to be by themselves .
So that 's a challenge or plea , addressed incredibly talentated community of TED .
Either we creative against climate change .
And let 's make it right . Thank you .

So , this game is very simple .
Everything you need to do is to read what you can see , okay ?
So , I 'll count , so you don 't have to do it .
One , two , three . Audience : Can you read it ?
BL : Amazing . And what about these ? One , two , three . Audience : This you the dirt .
BL : OK . One , two , three . ( Laughter ) I wish you speaking bra , right ? " " And about this ? One , two , three .
Audience : " What are you reading ?
BL : What 's you read ? There 's no words .
" I said , it 's reading that you see . It 's so ?
" " there 's written , " " " or you 're the blue ? ( Laughter ) It 's true ?
This is what you should say . " " Right ? " " Why is that ?
It 's because that perception is rooted in our experiences .
The brain will take a little information and factors of it for themselves any meaning , which means that we never see what there in the fact is , we never see the information , always we see just what was useful to see before .
That means that in terms of perception , we 're all like this frog .
( Laughter ) We get information , in which creates behavior that 's actually useful . " ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Video ) Man : And ! Ow ! ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) BL : But when things aren 't going to our idea a bit us roll it , right ?
But now we 're talking about sensing .
And perception under mention and determines everything that we think what we know what we believe , our desires , dreams , clothing that we wear , who in love with , everything starts in perception .
So if it 's perception rooted in our past , always fundamentally we deal as much as in the past .
But in fact , it 's a huge problem , because as then we can ever going to see differently ?
I would love to tell you the story about , how do we see differently and about that all new perceptions start the same way .
They begin question .
The problem is that the way questions insecurity .
Well , uncertainty is from an evolutionary point of view bad . If you 're not sure whether that 's it 's a predatorer is already late .
I don 't right ? ( Laughter ) Even sea disease is the implication of uncertainty .
And when you 're in the boat , according to your inner ear moves . Your eyes , because flow resonates with a ship , you say , that you 're standing without the necessary .
Your brain doesn 't know you with this uncertainty and do you wrong .
" And " " why ? " " is one of the most dangerous questions that you can ask , because causes insecurity . "
But irony at the same time remains that the only way of as to do anything new is in get in this space .
So how 's even possible do something new ? Well , fortunately , evolution provide answer .
And also allowed us to respond to the most difficult questions . The best questions are the ones that have the largest encyclopedia insecurity .
They 're the ones that study and ask for the things that you think it 's true . I don 't right ?
It 's easy to ask how started life , or what 's a universe , but to ask for what you yourself a true , it 's really the key walk into space .
And what 's a response of evolution on problem uncertainty ?
The game .
Here it 's not just process . Experts into a game they tell you that it 's a way of being .
Here 's one of the rare human withedh , where the uncertainty is basically celebrated . We don 't sure it 's what makes a game funny .
Can adapt change . The making new possibilities and needs collaboration . It 's basically our way social convering to and it 's an internally motivated . " " This means that we play to play . Here 's reward itself .
When we look at these five ways of being , it 's exactly the ways of being that you need to be a good the scientists .
Science is not defined with a method written on paper .
It 's actually a way of being , which is present , and that 's true what is creative .
So if you add to playing rules , you get game ( , isn 't play with rules and . )
And that 's what we called an experiment .
So it 's arms race idea that science is being and the way that the experiment is a game asked whether or not we can the scientists happen every ?
And who else if not 25 , eight to 10 year-old children ?
Because they 're experts on game . " " So I took his bee andrne into a small schools in Devly and goal was not only to be kids saw science different , but to through this process science could see ourselves differently .
The first step was ask the question .
And perhaps had kind of that at this study we didn 't get any money , because researchers said that little kids can 't significantly contribute to the scientific this notion and teachers again that kids don 't manage .
But even so , we looked at it . " " Of course . "
So , here are some of the questions . Theros them decrease , so you don 't have harassing their reading . The main the point here is that the five of questions that children came , were in fact the basic scientific papers during the last 5-15 years .
They asked the on things that are significant for aheaded scientists .
Now I 'd like to do is share stage with somebody really special .
It was one of the young people involved in this project , and now belongs between najmladš published scientists on world . When comes out on the stage , become the newest person who ever had a talk at TED .
But science and asking questions is thing courage .
And she 's you , courage , because it 's coming up here and it before you all .
So Amy , will you please come here to us ? " " ( Applause ) Amy help me tell a story about a project Blackawatons bees , but here 's a question that came . Amy , let 's like .
And Amy O " " That 'sole : Thank you , Beau . We thought it was simple see the continuity between people and monkey way in which they 're thinking , " " because they 're like .
But curious about us , if there 's a continuum with other animals . " " It would be amazing if people and the bees thought similar , because look so differently .
And so we asked if it 's possible that people and the bees solve complex problems the same way .
Indeed , we wanted to know whether also bees can adapt new things with using previous toed rules and conditions . So what if bees are able to think as us ?
Well , it would be amazing , because we 're talking about insects on with one million brain cells .
But it 's actually possible that could , because bees , in the same way that we do , they are able to recognize flowerina regardless of time day , light , weather , or angle , the flower to close . ( Applause ) BL : The next step was invent experiment that 's a game . So kids came up with experiment , this experiment , so , game . Amy , can you tell us how it was play and what a puzzle you for bees ready ?
" AndO : The call , with which came out was " "a-tac " " rule . "
We wanted from bees to learn not only come the flower particular color , but to go to flower the one and only if the colored has a certain pattern .
So they got the reward , just when in flown to yellowish flowers and these yellow flowers had blue the edge , or if blue flowers had yellow the edges .
There 's more ways of , in which they can bees learn to resolve this rows . The interesting question is how ?
What was on this project really exciting was that even actually , nor Beau we had no idea if it would work .
It 's a completely new , no one 's never before try , adults don 'ting . ( Laughter ) BL : And doesn 'ting a teachers , and it 's really difficult for them .
For scientist it 's easy to go without into something that should the idea about what 's doing , because it 's his job in the lab , but for teacher not be aware what happens at the end of the day ... very big because of belong Dave , Studwick , who worked on a project .
I 'm not going to go into the details of studies , because you can read it , " " but another step is observing . Here inid we as a few students makes observation . taking where bees fly .
( Video ) Dave Studwick : So what are we to do — Student : fiveC .
Dave Studwick : climbing up here ? Student : Yes .
Dave Studwick : It did not ahead of them eyes . Student : Henry , you can come to help me ?
"BL : " " Can you help me come , Henry ? " " Which good scientist say something like that , right ? "
Student : Here up there 's two .
And here 's three .
BL : So we performed observing . We 've obtained data .
We broke the simple mathematicals , found an average , and so on .
And we wanted to our findings share . That was another step .
We had them with write and try to their destination . First of all , we had to write , with .
We went , of course , or in the pub . ( Laughter ) That 's on the left is my , " " ? " " ( Laughter ) And I explained to them that , you know , these publication live compartmentalized in four different parts : introduction , used method , the results and discussion .
In illuminate what we ask , and why ?
Metom , what you 're doing ? The finding , what you 're observations find ?
And discussion , is about- who 's interested , right ?
That 's in short scientific publication . ( Laughter ) So kids me imposed and I write with in the same place , which means that publication is written of the child 's language .
" I write it I do . I wrote it Amy and her peer . That 's why this scientific publication starts with : " " Once , there was . " " ( Laughter ) In parts about findingss say : Cvial phase , guessh blah blah blah ... " " aaa , " " ? " " ( Laughter ) And in used methods say , " " After we bees put into the refrigerators ( vacake did , " " totler . ( Laughter ) This is a scientific publication . We wanted to make it . "
And this is a previewed page . We have here are just a couple of authors .
All the names of listed here eye type belong eight to 10 year the pupils .
" How 's the first authored basic school in the Blackawaton , because if somebody ever from call this study , used would " " Belakwton and knee . " " , without individuals . And so we sent to Journallu accessible public , which we received to followed the answer : " "
" " " " I publicationroom outside our atro control qualities , and that 's for a number of reasons . " " ( Laughter ) In other words , this starts words " " Once , there was " " numbers are written intoss , etc . " ( Laughter ) They said that they 're responded . I sente 's " " Purves , of scientific National Academy ( Ga Geographic Academy of Science ) , bigger worldem neurologist , who said , " " This is the most , powerfuled scientific publication I ever read " " — ( Laughter ) — " deserve definitely the proper attention . " "
" Learry Malones , an expert on the vision , said , " " The these publication 's great . "
" Sal would publishing if it wrote someone adult . " " So we did what ? We sent back publisher . "
And I refused it .
Then we asked Larry ande Hem suffering , to commented on the scientists our findings , was recruited them into biblography , and they sent to of Biologs Letters .
That 's where our story read and value ofed independent of five asers , and published it . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Samoted attempt took four months , but two years until it attempted . ( Laughter ) Typical science , right ? " " And so from Amy and her schoolmates became youngest scientists around the world who 've ever published article .
And then what was response ?
And the article published two days before Christmas , first day it off 300,000 people .
It was about Tip bossreactor in Science , the scientific-gas me .
And the article is also forever approached in megassly Biologs Letters .
It 's the only free available an article in this Journal .
Last year , it was the other only morey publication in Biologs Letters , they don 't just from the scientists but also teachers and broad section of the public .
Let me read just one response .
" " just , " " I read ( studying ) " "Blak 's what Newtonian bees " " Don 't enough me words for describing my feelings . "
What you 've done is real , true and amazing .
curiosity , interest , innocentness and excitement for thing are the most fundamental and important predictions for every scientist .
Who else has larger predictions as children ?
" Pleaselling a clap your child 's this team for me . " " I 'd his speech is a metaphor of physics . "
I can try it for you ? ( Laughter ) Okay , about , but so . Let 's .
Science is about risking and this is immense risk . ( Laughter ) For me , not for it . Because this is what we 've done so far only time . ( Laughter ) I love the little you technology , right ?
Shimon Schocken : Yeah , but I love ourselves as well .
BL : That 's the ideal are sum of meaning technologies .
So — ( Laughter ) Okay . ( Laughter ) Now we do a smaller a demonstration , okay ?
You 've got to put your eyes and show you where you hear me clapping . Okay ?
( Holes ] ( Hole ] Okay what if all of what are there said screw . One , two , three ?
Audience : (Kris ) ( Laughter ) (Kris ) ( Laughter ) We existsco . Now you asking , open your eyes . We do that whole again .
All of us , who are bend over there . (Kris ) Where have the sound coming ? ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) What 's the point all this ? The point is what makes us science .
And typically migrating life responding to this situation , but if sometimes we 're going to do something differently , we need to step into the unknown . Whenve opened your eyes , saw the world in a new way .
That 's what gives you science . It offers us the opportunity go into the unknown using games .
I think that true science should people give space on their own opinion and would allowing them this view expressing , that 's why I asked Amy , to ended this talk .
And Amy ?
AO : This project for me was actually very exciting , because it 's revived process discovering and showed me that every , and I mean everyone , has the potential to discover something new , and that 's also a little question can lead to a discovery .
And take someone 's the way I think about something , it can be easy or hard process . That all depends on how we build the person 's a change .
But change the way that I 'm over science in was thinking I was surprisingly simple . Once we played game , and then we started thinking about arguka . Then I realized that science is not only boring subject , and everyone could discover something new .
You just opportunity and that my came the Beau and project Blackawatons bees .
Thank you . BL : Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
" He writes the year 1800 .
It 's about an anomalous inventions .
This is called the microscope .
It allows see tiny life forms that we don 't see the naked eye .
Doctors pretty soon they 're finding that many of them cause a terrifying human diseases .
Imagine what is in society happen , when realized that English women 's the tea , but the cotyl full of monster . The picture is from London , not far from here .
The 200 years later .
The downloaded the cots is still here , the cows in developing countries tropical of band .
Just the actual malaria causes a million deaths a year . More than one billion people 's endangered different kinds of malaria and needs to go tests .
And it 's light up to these monsters it 's not that hard .
You take staining-inter , and see about field , or fluorescent color or Giems and microscope and you observe .
Each has a face .
Why then Alex from Kenya , Fatima from Bangladesh , Andyoot of the bomby and Juli and Mary of Uganda waiting for months , to figure out what they 're disease ?
Especially because that it would never be enough classic diagnostic devices .
Remember the number of : billion .
The problem lies in alone , microscopes .
And the top of modern science , the microscope , because the accidents for observing on the ground .
He 's actually wasn 't supposed to diagnosis .
It 's hard , big , difficult to maintain and is expensive .
Two my students , Jim and James , to traveled India and Thailand and I were considering this problem .
We 've given kinds of devices .
In some lens grows mushrooms .
And some people didn 't my functional microscope don 't turn on .
The upshot of this effort and roads was idea to things , which we called the Foldscope .
What 's going on ?
Foldscope is completely functional microscope witho , the field , polarization , projection , all of advanced functions and store 's purely from paper .
So you probably curious , as it 's possible .
So let me show you a few examples and some you go .
It 's becoming one letter of paper .
There are all kinds of panels on thes a functional fluorescented microscope .
It 's three parts : Ooptics , illumination and Clon .
What 's micro-opic , that 's in the promoted directly into the paper .
On paper is not the recipe in any language .
It 's been printed colored code in which , you know , like from the- former microscope .
They looks something like this , and it 's got all functions typical microscope . So here 's a cross desk where putting in samples , that 's here .
This is the new , but all the classiced stains remain on many different diseases .
You can put a sample ,
What 's in this really good and students hate , when I 'm going to do that , but still , it 's her 's resilience .
I can it turn on a , about the ground and try to trampled .
He 's even though that is of such a fold of the material that it is paper . "
It also is fun , there we send that normally like regular diagnosticy instrument . But in this way , I 'm 30 different pholdscops on different purposes , all in one front .
And one would choose .
This we designed specifically for malaria , because they 're in it fluorescent filters to diagnosing malaria .
So we have special microscopes to an individual diseases .
As you 've never seen , which you might in this microscope to see .
I would like to show you something , if we can down the lights please . With a pholdscop , " Because we can even to project .
" " I switch off these two microscopes , unders go to walls and I would you exactly what you 've seen in the microscope .
You 're looking at — ( Applause ) This is a cutaway composed a zoom in and when , going through os of , " "
you can see also how lenses are linked in the the birth .
Now you see my favorite insects that like I hate this . The antennas . You see mosquitoes of ps left column .
Mymo here .
Just on the device that I just described .
Can you see how it ray of light bend and translates .
Might we respond to experience ?
Now I give you , very quickly , I 'll say to me , " " because there 's time , how much costs us their production . We make method , roll-to-roll , so on pieces and spending , we spend just 50 cents .
( Applause ) Because we can actually think about what a new paradigm in microscopy , we call it a " " and " " Come on . " "
You see a piece of paper
and how we considered new ideas .
Paper has dimensions A4 .
Here are the three parts that I mentioned .
Optical components here are in the top right , we needed to figure out how to make lenses embedded in paper at high the production capacity . We 're harnessing process its self-assembly process and the surface tensions to make andmatic lenses right in the paper .
Sem go lenses .
Here 's resources of light .
Finally , all parts of the basically setting in myself as origami . Because this origami allows on a micrometer accurate optical youlaying .
The other thing we of course tried to evidence that our microscope is resilient , was to come to 3 . floor and drop it down .
Here 's and survive .
Ouring another goal is completely testing terrain .
We 're starting by the end of the summer .
Soon we make thousands of microscopes .
We started to collect data about malaria , Chagas 's disease and gardioize from the patients .
Let me end it with this image .
It 's mind me , but there 's an interesting continuity between practical education and the world 's health .
What tools actually we provide ? Children , that will fight against the co oflu monsters in the future .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So , it 's year5 , I 'm in college and with one friend of go on drip of Providence (R agreement Island ) until Portland (Oregon ) .
You know , we 're young and unemployed , so we decide the whole thing solve a sideal travels through national parks , protected forests — with , we 've selected the longest way , what they can .
Well , somewhere in the middle South Da &#s turning to my friend and I ask her question that I mean for about 2,000 miles .
" " What 's the Chinese character that I still see going ? " "
My friend looking at me with complete empty quarter view .
In fact , Mr. here in front line is perfectly shows her expression .
" ( Laughter ) And I 'm explaining her : " " Well , you know , you all the brands that we see with a Chinese sign . " " She just still looking at me , saying , and then there 's because it 's what I 'm talking about . "
And that 's what I 'm saying is this .
( Laughter ) Yeah , known the Chinese character for the pic eva zone . ( Laughter )
For the past five years of life I deals mentalizing over the situations exactly like this — why sometimes we don 't understand the sign of around us , how we behave when this happens , and we can tell that it 's all about human nature .
In other words , as you heard say Chris , the last five years I deal by thinking about how I 'm wrong .
This might seem like strange choice employment , but actually it 's one big advantage : no work competition .
( Laughter ) The truth is , many of us do everything it can to avoid the idea that can go to error , or at least the idea that there 's choice , that we were wrong .
As an abstract concept that everybody can understand .
We all know that everyone in this room makes mistakes .
Humanity in general is errored — okay , okay .
But when it comes to me right now , everything in what I believe , now in this room in the time , suddenly all this abstract assessment , unfortunately , error ideas out the window , and I actually don 't figure out what I 'm wrong .
And here 's in this room , so that 's the time in which we live .
We go to meeting in the palan time , you go to family vacations in palan time , in we vote in this room in the time .
So essentially , we all flying life get caught in a kind of trap the small bubbles feeling that in everything we have the truth .
I think that this is a problem .
I think that this is a problem for everyone as personality in our personal and professionalismed , and I think that it 's also collective problem us as a culture .
So , what I want to do is first , talking why we stuck inside this feeling to the truth .
And second , why it 's the problem .
And recently I want to convince you that it 's possible , take out of this feelings , and that if you do this , it 's the biggest morals , intellectually and creatives jump , what you can do .
So , why are we stuck in this feeling of have right ?
One reason is actually something about it , we 're wrong .
I want to ask you something , or actually , I want to ask something you , because you 're right here : What 's a feeling — emotional — what it feels like when you 're wrong ?
The horred , pinging down .
Thembing . " " Okay , great , good .
The horred , palm downs , hambing — thank you , these are great answers , but it 's answer to a different question .
It 's answer to the question : What 's feeling to realize that we 're wrong ?
( Laughter ) Beholding that you 're wrong can be like some of this and so many other things that ?
It could be the devastating , can be like discovery , it can be a fun , like my stupid mistake with a Chinese characters .
But just wrong is not no feeling .
I 'll give you an logical example .
Do you look at the Loony Tunes cartoons ? There , so the breastfet , which is always trying , but never hold the line ?
Almost every episode of this cartoons is the moment where a jot chasing and the at suddenly you run off a cliff , what 's okay , it 's a bird , knows flying .
But the thing is , though , that the jott would be going outside of a cliff right after him .
And what it 's funny — at least if you have six years — it 's that they 's also a perfectly fine .
They 're running on — and to a moment when we look down , and they realize that it 's in the air without land under the legs .
And then falls .
When you 're in something wrong — not when we realize that we 're wrong , but that 's before — we are as the jot . After run out of a cliff and before look down .
You know , we 'll prove them wrong idea , we 've got problem , but still feel that we have a dry ground under leg .
So actually , I should fix what I 've said before .
They 's a feeling . It 's feeling like having right .
( Laughter ) So this is one reason , structured is the reason why we stuck in feeling of the rightness .
I call it the blindness fault .
Most of the time , we don 't have a lot of internal provocations , that could say that are wrong , until it 's too late .
But here 's also a second reason why we stuck in this feeling of and this is culturals .
And it 's the star elementary school .
You sit in class , your teacher you given results from the writings , and one of them looks like this .
It 's not my , by the way .
( Laughter ) So you 're here at elementary school , and know exactly what you 've got to think about the baby , who got this paper . "
It 's silly child , that what makes problems , that what would never ' homework .
So in time when you have nine years , the first thing you 've learned is that the people what they 'll do mistakes are just lazy and unansing I — and in the second line , that the road , as I succeeding in life , is never do no mistakes .
These really bad , we learns really well .
And a lot of us — and I think that , in particular , many of us in this room — with that balanceing so that they become perfecting unitary sections , perfoists , too dream will redefines individuals .
It 's so , Mr. CFO , and astrophysicist , ultra-ma shortone ?
( Laughter ) As it turns out , you 're all CFO , astrophysics , ultra-ma shortonists .
Okay , fine .
In addition , that all we 're angry at possibility , that we 've done something wrong .
Because according to this , do something wrong , means that it 's something wrong with us .
So just take that we have the truth , because they make us feel like we 're smart and liable and chisting and safe .
So let me tell you a story .
A couple of years ago , the woman comes to Beth Israel Deconss Medical Center for surgeonic surgery .
Beth Israel 's in Boston .
It 's a hospital where medical students come from Harvard , one of the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman 's going to come and take it into operating the auditorium .
Are andnastsia , surgeon do their job — " " it 's a back and send it in the room .
And everything looks fine .
" And waking up and looks at myself down and said , " " Why is it in bandages the opposite side of my body ? " " " Well , the wrong side its body is in bandages because the operation surgeon performed on her left leg , a place her right leg . "
When Vice President of for quality health care in Beth Israel talk about this incident , said something very interesting .
" He said , " " whatever reason , surgeon simply thought was on the right side of patient . " " ( Laughter ) The point this story is that tooed trust in the sense that we are on the right side of something can be very dangerous . "
This inner feeling the rightness that we experience all so often isn 't trust the guided of what 's really going on in the outside world .
And when we behave so that it 's , and we stop imagine possibility that we get wrong , so it 's the moment where we 're starting to do things like you pouring 200 million-gallons oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or pollination trunk of the world economy .
So it 's a big practical problem .
But it 's also a social problem .
Think about it for a moment , what it means to feel that we have the truth .
It means that you think your beliefs just perfectly match reality .
And when you do this , you have here in solving one problem is that as explain Do you all those people who disagreeing with you ?
It stems so that most of us these people explains the same by turn on a series of unhappy assumptions .
The first thing that usually do when someone doesn 't agree with us is that we assume that it 's aighrant .
It doesn 't have access to the same information as we have we and so when with him generously these information theyth , to see light and are adding to our team .
When 's , and it 's so that these people are exactly the same facts like us and still with us disagree , so moving to another assumption , which is that they 're all idiots .
( Laughter ) They 're all right pieces , and they 're too s left to right you put them together .
And when it 's not that 's when you show that people who disagree with using have exactly the same facts like us and they 're actually really smart , so I will move to the thirdm assumption : they know right , and her to deliberately wind for their own sinister purposes .
This is a disaster .
This attaching to own the rightness to prevent us from mistakes , when it 's absolutely need and causes that we have to treated the core .
But , what 's the most mysterious and most tragic on all this is that it 's comes about the sense of to be human .
It 's like we 've wanted to be that our minds are just perfectly cleared windows and we of them just looking out and we describe unveiling the world .
We want to make every look from this the same window and saw this same thing .
That 's not true , and if it 's true was , so life would be incredibly boring .
The wonder in your mind 's not that the world you see so , what 's .
But it 's see , what 's not .
We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it was like to be no other person a different place .
And all this we do something different , which is why we 're all the same can look up at the night sky and see this and this and this .
And andńo , it 's also why in things we 're wrong .
"1200 years ago , Descartes said his familiar thing about " " I think , therefore I am . " " This man , St. Augustine sat down and wrote " " Fallore ergon withum " " — " understand , therefore I am . " "
Andguists understand that our ability to something to infect is not some sort of hambating in they in human system , it 's something that we can you lately , or get through this thing .
It 's and suled absolutely a basic thing of what we are .
Because contrary to God , we really don 't know what 's out there .
And contrary to other animals , we are obsessed with trials 's find out .
For me , this obsession with is the source of the root and all our productivity and creativity .
" Last year , for various different reasons , found I 'm listening to a lot of episod public radio show " " This the American life . " "
And so you listen and listen to , and at some point , I 'll start to feel that all these stories are about how we 're wrong .
" And my first thought was , " " I was lost . "
I became a crazy Lady of wrongness .
" They 's everywhere I 'll be " " and it 's happened . "
But a few months later , I get a chance to make interviews with Ir Glass , that it 's this show .
"po rewarded him this thing . " " and he said , " " No , actually , it 's a true " "
" And in fact , " " on says , " " Hm , that each one episod our show me the same hidden a mathematician . "
" And this hidden a math is : " " I think that 's going to happen this thing and it instead of something else happened . " " And here 's just say " " Ira Glass , " " , since this needed .
" We need these moments surprises and thes and wrongness , these stories to work . " " And for the rest of us — members of audience , listenerss , readers , we that we 're these things . "
We have like so things like- the-s , false traces and surprising endings .
When it comes to our stories , we like , when we 're wrong .
But you know , our stories are these , because our lives are that looks like that .
We think that it 's going to happen one thing . " " and instead , becomes something else .
George Bush thought that when will attack Iraq find a lot of the weapons of mass destruction , free and bring people democracy in high East .
And instead of something else happened .
And Honi Mubaak thought that will be dictators in Egypt all his life , until it 's not too old , or too sick to go , and then the government in his son .
And instead of something else happened .
And maybe you thought to you get older , you 'll have a wedding with your love from high school and for being adding back to hometown , and you 'll together to raise the kids .
And instead of something else happened .
And I have to say that I think that I 'm writing properly heart 's a book about things that we all unknownś , for the audience , in which never find toing .
And instead of something else happened .
( Laughter ) I mean , that 's life .
For good for bad , genering these amazing stories about the world around us and then the world turn around and impressed us .
Without insult , but this whole Conference is incredible monument our ability to do things wrong .
We 've spent my whole week talking about innovations and the progresss and enhancements , but you know why we need all of these innovation and progresss and enhancements ?
Because half of the things that are most mind-trasing and the world-nah using — TED8 — ands .
( Laughter ) Very it didn 't works , right ? ( Laughter )
" " Where is my istpack Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) So again to come up .
And it goes on .
It comes with the next idea .
We 're talking another story .
Will we do next conference .
T 's this particularma , as you 've heard today — for about a seven million times is reinventing of wonders .
" And for me , if you want to reinventing of wonder , you have to take out of that a little , of the rightness of space and look around at each other and look at vastness and the complexity and the secretness of the universe and be capable to say , " " Wow , I don 't know . "
" Maybe I 'm wrong . " " Thank you . "
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
Sustainability includes what , where and howls out .
The question that 's important for me , who and why .
I know people , which I pick food .
I want to know how to affects .
I want to know how they affect me .
I want to know why they fish .
I want to know how rely on generosity waters , when they want to earn .
This understanding of these things allows us to experience donations the sea as good , and they began to see as their opportunity to restore our ecosystem .
It allows us to celebrate donations sea that we can afford to eat .
How do we called ?
Prospert donations sea .
Sustainability means ability for persisting and maintain , and the helpfulness is the ability to again and grow .
These food allows create evolving and dynamic system , and reinforces our relationship to the ocean as source , suggesting that we 're trying about reo revival of the oceans , and it 's about encourage their resistance .
It 's more hope , human and , much more useful way of understanding our environment .
Inreck 's the recipes — common thing with a lot of marine protects — it 's useful and a great tool .
Green , yellow and red lists marine species .
It 's very simple : buy green , don 't red , yellow set of you to think of twice .
Well , I think that 's not enough to eat really just the green .
It 's not sustainable , as far as scale of the success will not be change fate species on yellow and red list .
And what if we add kind is just by green list ?
Here 's tuna yellowfining , is c on thedoc — of sustainable 's population .
We 'lled inding — no than viadscats .
It 's great for fishermen . Big profit . The support system local economy .
But it 's a lion seas . It 's a top predator .
What 's in the background of this food ?
" " Sa bottom in steakhouse to pounds of porce of this food ?
Three times a week ?
We can be in the green list , but I don 't the kindness or it 's not , it 's not the ocean .
The point is , we have to see correlation , have measureer for ours .
An example : I heard that red wine 's great for my health — antioxidants and the minerals — heart healthy .
Good job ! I love red wine !
I 'm going to drink a lot of . " " I will be so healthy .
But how many of these bottles tell me , that 's the problem ?
Well friends , there 's a problem with whitesins .
We 've lost sensitivity , when it 's food , and we pay for .
The problem is that costs hide under waves .
Hiding those cost for social acceptableness expanding the circuit in the tape .
And hide the costs a huge profits .
First of all , food from group of gifts sea really takes into account our needs .
" " Jaws , Flipper or fishing from companies Gorton 's not the beneficial donations sea , it 's more Jolly Green Giant (z advertising on vegetables . )
Greenina : could save the oceans .
Sylvia 'd like to say is that that blue is the new green .
And I with respect argument is that green broccoli could be new blue .
We need to continue to eat the best donations sea , if it 's even possible .
We 've got their right to eat a tons of vegetables .
Best of group of gifts of the sea , is that they 're served to then , and with bottle Tabasca , and with wheels emotionron .
" The serves 140g you was coverse in disjoishly its and the crisp crop-ined aka , and with a bunch of " "risota " " from quoins with crisp , ilvan of brocco street , and he 's so sweet , and in a woman 's , and it 's wasted on the surface , only with the make a ored . "
Ju of interest !
That 's sell .
The coolest thing about this is that every family has all the ingredients to reach at a local self-ob run .
Jamie Oedavier leads campaign to Americans saved from their way diets .
Sylvia 's leading campaign for saving the oceans from our way diets .
It turns out there 's a similarity .
Forget about a nuclear holocaust concerned about ; the need forks .
He 's weed our planet , and then we geted food used so that we 're even more broken his situation .
So I think our eating is wrong .
I think it 's time that we 've changed our expectations from food .
Sustainability is complicated , but lunch is the thing that 's all very well we understand ,
So let 's start here .
And that 's happening in the interests of ecoed getting more food .
Dan Barber and Alice Wters dedicatly lead a revolution in an ecological and tased diet .
E ecological diet us often as consumers leads to inducing accountability .
Just because something 's coming from the ecological resources doesn 't mean that to that we can behavelessly .
We have ecological shrimp .
We have the technology to their an ecological production .
But we will never have unlimited ecological sense buffet with shrimptas .
It didn 't work would be .
Food beneficial for heart is important parts beneficial diets from seafood .
Whereas trying of the bottomaring plummeting marine population , the media recommend higher energy fruits sea .
The study say , that 's tens of thousands of American grandmothers , grandfather , I have and his father 's they mighty to get other birthn , if consumed more fruits sea .
I 'm willing to give up to this benefit .
But it 's not just about fertils sea .
It 's the way we look at bowl .
As serifs , I discovered that the easiest place , if smallerion , the stuff on our plate .
It became a couple of things .
" We 've made more money .
People began to buy a curs and lettuces , because they knew that only the main meal they won 't enough .
spent more time over his food , spent more time together in food .
In short , got more than the what arrived , even though get less proteins .
We 've obtained more calories of disparate meals .
Prospered their health . I 'm more save .
That 's delicious .
In each plate , was to served by some matterness to fill this environment , but also big portion matterness to fill with interest from people itself .
The other thing we did : serveing more diverse species — most frequently narrower , and swallow merely ,rins .
Actually , withvas , oyster , different edible you , youed — these most .
So we pusheds to flexible , more beneficial possibilities .
This we need to support .
This recommend green list .
And it 's a possible the beginning againo healing our environment .
But what with these big predators , these eleganty species , with the tunas from green list , which I talked about ?
If it 's for you guys , I 'd been recipe .
It works well for any big kind of fish in the oceans , so here 's .
So , you start with 450 s the big fish .
Take a knife . They cut it into four pieces .
Give them in four plate .
So you put these plates a bunch of vegetables and open the best bottle burgundian , what you 've got to , you with candles , and ova it .
The famous you an opportunity , you can eat .
Invite the friends and neighbors and frompa say it once a year , the eminent .
From the food I expect many .
Life 's health and joy , and family , and society .
Life that preparing ingredients , preparings and their consumeation is part of connection human interests .
I had lucky that my father was a fantastic cooks .
Very soon me overed about privilege , which consumeation food is .
Okay , the thing I remember about is from my childhood .
They were smart portions throughout the protein served with a plentiful amount of vegetables and little bit of starches , usually with rice .
This is the mostly dieting today .
I 'm coming to see when I 'm wrong , you 'reakhouse .
And I 'm from it .
It 's like a monkey of protein .
It 's disgusting .
But of all of those terrible news that you hear , and you 'll hear about the state of the oceans , and unfortunately I 've got to tell you , it 's the worst that all that time was your mother right .
It 'll get you also vegetables .
It 's very simple .
So , what 's in the food we look for ?
I am healthy ingredients that they are good for my body .
And I 'm seeks me joy and salt and sexy things , to let food disgusted as a sentence .
And I 'm seek family recipes that worshipping my personal story .
For society right to start at the very beginning .
You can 't escape from the fact that everything we eat has global consequences .
I try to figure out how best you know what the consequences are , and then make the first step towards their minimum habitat .
We 've seen picture of our blue planets , our global banks .
But it 's more than just a pieces of raw materials ; it 's also global geography community that we call the lunch . "
So if you 'll take only 's necessary , about the rest we can start division , we can start to celebrate , we can startt repairing .
We 've got to sort of bask vegetables .
We 've got to sort of bask smaller portions throughout the fruits of the sea .
We have to save for lunch .
Thank you .

In 1986 , much more than people started talking about ecological problems and environment , I started paper test tubeoc as building materials .
Tests to new the design files materials are very complicated . This was not much tougher than I had expected , and because it 's an industrial material , easily we can on the " " Igning also do flame-or .
In 2000 was in Germany big exhibition .
I built pavilion of papers the tubes , from recyclable of paper .
The goal of design is not building to finish .
That was the goal of my design .
that 's invisible .
They 're using the most , to they changed their power and money by creating monumental architecture .
So I started to work in crisis areas .
In 1994 was in African of Rwanda big conflict .
The fighted against each other two tribes , Hut and Tutsi .
More than two millions of people became refugees .
what led to a deforestation and ecological to the problem .
So they started provide aluminum pipes ,
" And he said , " you " " My God ! You had gone mad ? !
They like this lived under plastice sails in the park .
So I have proposed to rebuilding them ,
So in 2001 , I also built shelter in West India .
I was asked to I built the temporary church .
It 's still use , even after last earthquake in China .
In 2009 , they had also earthquake in Italian of L 'Aquiile .
I designed to head , the character of makeshift mod andy .
After the earthquake and tsunami had to be people evacuing into the great rooms , like the training horse .
But it was really needed .
Now , I work in New Zealand in Christchurch .
Thank you very much .
What 's place in this child mind ?
If you this asked people 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would say , that 's a baby 's irrationally , counterintuitive , egocentric view that can 't take another person or understand cause and a consequence of .
In the last 20 years , balance of science completely make this idea .
So , in some ways , think that thinking this child is like thinking the best scientists .
Let me give you one example .
One thing I would this child could think what could be to place in their mind , it 's trying to figure out what is going on in the mind of another child .
After all , one of the things that 's hardest for all of us , it 's figure out what they think and other people feel .
And maybe the hardest thing of all , it 's figure out what other people are thinking and sense , it 's not actually exactly what it is we think and feel .
Anyone who 's watching politics , can to suggesting how difficult it is for some people understand this .
We wanted to know if babies and little children can understand this profound thing about other people .
So the question is : How do we get their could ask ?
Children yet unable to speak , and if you ask a three-year-old to tell you what 's mind you get a beautiful flowing stream of consciousness about a pos and a birthday and stuff .
So they actually to ask the question ?
Well it turns out that secret was in broccoli .
Bety Rapache , one of my students , and I gave children — we are two dish with food : one meland with raw brocco street , and one meland with latteds .
All the kids , even in Berkeley , like certaints and don 't likee broccoli .
( Laughter ) But then what Bety did was that to tasted food from every dish .
And faced , like her very disgusted or not .
Half of the time treated so that she likets and doesn 't like to broccoli — just like little kid and everyone else normal person .
But half the time , take a pieces , did , " "mmm , broccoli .
It tasteed broccoli . " " Mmmm . " " And then I took a bittep and did , " " " Yuck , ,ts .
It tastedts . Ble , Yuck . " " So it 's acting , like it 's what she was the opposite of what they wanted the kids .
This we 're doing with 15 and 18 months with the kids . "
And then they 'd her hand , and she says , " " me 's a few ? " "
So the question is : What her gave a child , what the disgusted is , or a disgusted her ?
And remarkable about was that 18-month-old babies , just barely go and talking , her gavets , if like wasts , but they gave her broccoli , as long as its enjoy broccoli .
On the other hand , 15 monthly kids at her long looked , when faced that she like broccoli , as if it couldn 't understand .
But then , what we had been looking at for a long time , they gave her justts , what they thought , there 's got to enjoy everybody .
Maybe there 's see the two really remarkable things .
The first of those is that these small 18-month-old children already found this profound fact of human nature that we 're not always the same . "
More importantly , they felt that they actually supposed to do things , in order to help other people to get what they want .
But even more remarkableer 's the fact that 15 monthly children 's done , indicating that 18-month-old children learned this deep reality of human nature in three months from the age , when they were 15 months .
So kids know more and learn more than we might think .
And this is just one of hundreds of hundreds of studies , and in the last 20 years , that 's showing up .
The question that you might ask is : Why are babies so much to learn ?
And how is it possible that so many learn in a very short period of time ?
After all , if you look at the kids surface is not of them no benefits .
And in many ways , it 's worse , the proto because we spend so much time and energy just to survive .
But when you look at how evolution answers an mystery , why we spend so much time caring forned these children , it turns out that actually there 's the answer .
When we look at the many and so many different kinds of animals , not just in primates , but also other mammals , birds , even on in Osce as theed , and in thebay , it turns out that there 's relationship between how long childhood kind of has and how big are their brains in comparison to the body , and what they 're smart and flexible .
" " And overalls birds this ideas are birds on the screen .
On the one hand , it 's new rockedonn inran .
Inrans and other ppe birds , hatrans , and so on , they 're incredibly smart birds .
They 're in the same directions smart as chimpanzees .
And this is a bird on the covers journal Science , who 've learned to use tool to get the food .
On the other hand we have our known , withlip of homework .
And chickens , duck , fidds and seas are just silly .
So they 're very , very good in a rhinors , and they are not too good for anything else .
It turns out that calves new rockdoian in defense , stay in nests until operating .
They 're dependent on their moms that drop worms into their little of opens up into their two years , what 's really long time in life bird .
" By contrast chickens to succeed in just a few months .
So childhood 's the reason why end inrans on the cover of Science and chickens in a pot design in the soup .
Longy normal life seems to be connected with knowledge and learning .
So what explanation for that we have ?
Some animals , for example , chickens , seem to be beautifully equipped to good quality perform one single things .
They seem to be be so beautifully equipped to thebing ofrna in one environments .
Other creatures , as they 're in defense , there are actually very good for anything particular , but are extremely good in learning about lawss different environments .
Of course , we , human beings , we 're completely else but in defense .
We have a much larger brains relative to body than itsk other animal .
We 're smarter , adapting , we know more to learn , survive in diversest environments , migration we cover the world , and made it into the universe .
And our children are dependent on us a much longer than children other species .
My son is 23 years .
( Laughter ) At least , until 23 , don 't have them stillhit we worms in those little open mouthos .
So why would we saw connection ?
It 's theory that strategy of learning is extremely powerful , the strong strategy as in the world forward , but she 's one big disadvantages .
The downside is that while you 're still learning , you 'll be helpless .
" So , when you mind mast wateront , you don 't want to think about , "ak or maybe about spear could have . But what of it is better ? " "
That 's everything you want to know more , than to mast wateront ever show .
The way that evolution will solve this problem , it 's a kind of behind the work .
According to this theory we have the earliest period , when we completely protected .
We don 't do quite nothing . Only learn .
And then , in adulthood , we can take everything we 're taught as kids , and it 's used in the real world .
One way to look at it , it 's that children are like separation research and development of the human race .
They 're protected drownist , whose job it is to go out , to learn and to have good ideas , and we 're production and marketing .
We need to all the ideas that we learned when we were kids , and to make the most in practice .
Another way to look at it , it 's consider kids for fail adults , we 'd better take them as another development , phase of the same kind of — something like caterpillars did and butterflies — with the difference that they are the fantastic butterflies , which flying for garden or a study , and we caterpillars did that slowly climbed his sk road adulthood .
If it 's true , if they 're children adapted to learning — and this evolutionary story report that they are , it 's it , that 's predestined by the — we can expect to have really strong mechanisms of learning .
And actually , the brain baby seems to be the most powerful computer on learning on this planet .
Even when real computers it slowly transcend .
More recently , in our understanding of machine learning happened revolution .
It 's built on ideas this gentleman , Reveranda , Thomas Bayesa , statistics and a mathematician from the 18th century .
Bayes provide a mathematical applications theory probabilities on the characterization , the description wayy scientists knows the world .
Scientists processing so that they have a hypothesis that they want to get started .
They 're testing it and the evidence .
The evidence of their a hypothesis change .
And then testing a new hypothesis and so on .
Bayes has shown us a mathematical way to do it .
This math 's really the crux of the best programs for learning machines we have today .
About 10 years ago , I came up with theory that the babies make exactly the same thing .
So , if you want to know what happens behind these beautiful brown eyes , I think that looks like this .
This is a notebook Revern Babye . " "
So , I think that babies actually make complex calculations with conditioned the odds that devaluing , to find out how the world works .
And that seems to be more heaviest task .
Because , even when statistics ask adults , look extremely silly .
How could it be possible that statistics doing kids ? "
And we 're tested , we 're a machine that we called the Bedcket Detector
It 's box that glows and play music , when at her you put the right objects .
So using this very simple machine just made my and other lab dozens of studies show how good are babies in learning about the world .
Just one we did with Tumar of the Rousne , my students .
If I showed this detector , you would you first thought that activates it because it 's that you put the cube .
In fact , this detector works a little strange .
Because , if the cube waves in you over detector , what should you early on certainly mind detector is activate in two of the three trials .
And if you do it likely to put the cube on detector , activate has only at two in six repeating .
So don 't likeed hypothesis is actually have stronger evidence .
It seems that wave is much more effective than the other strategy .
We 've done it ; put four-year-old kids this pattern showing and asked them to launch it .
And indeed , these four-year-old children used evidence , and she 's an objected over the detector .
Two things are in really interesting .
First of all , it 's mind in that it 's a four-year-olds .
Meanwhile just teach to count .
But they 're doing without realiz complex calculations that will determine value condition-based probabilities .
The second thing that is interesting is that the use this evidence to get some sense , hypotheses for world , which seems to be veryly unlikely .
Similar studies that we 're doing in my lab , have shown that the kids would show up four-year-old only unlike the hypothesis rather than adults who got the same puzzle .
I mean , in these circumstances kids use statistics to knowing the world , but they 're doing because scientists also experiments , we wanted to see if it 's also kids do experiments .
When kids experimenting , we 're talking the testing everything possible , or also that playing . We were published multiple studies that have shown that play is in fact this kind of experimental research program .
Here 's one of the lab Cristne Legare .
Cristly she , used our Blicket Detector .
Like , the kids that yellow activate it and the red don 't , and then showed them anomaly .
Now you 'll see , as this little boy went five hypotheses : in two minutes .
( Video ) Boy : And what this ?
And just like the other side .
Andison Goum : OK , his first hypothesis was refuted .
( Laughter ) Boy : This shineed and this nothing .
AG : OK , out you a notebook with his on trials .
Boy : What 's actuallyss ?
( Laughter ) I don 't .
AG : Every scientist recognize this expression of despair .
( Laughter ) Boy : Ah , because it has to be like this and thiss like this .
AG : OK , hypothesis number two .
Boy : So .
The .
( Laughter ) AG : This is another idea .
" He said the experimenter , to do this , to try to ask to other place .
It also doesn 't work .
Boy : Oh , because light it 's just like that , here 's not .
Ah , the bottom this box has in it electricity , and this electricity doesn 't have .
AG : OK , that 's fourth hypothesis .
Boy : The light .
So when we put four .
Four here , to shinelo , and two here , to shine .
AG : OK , that 's his fifth hypothesis .
This is a particularly lovely and artation boy , but what Cristly discovered , is that this is a quite the usual .
When you watch children when they when you ask them to explain something , what 's actually they 're doing , it 's a series of experiments .
Let 's a four-year-old children it 's pretty common .
Well , what 's like to be creation ?
What is one of these amazing butterflies , who can five hypothesis to test for two minutes ?
If we go back to the psychologists and the philosophers , many of them said that the babies and children perceive just by a little bit , if something .
And I think it 's true .
I think that 's babies and children perceiving more than adults .
It 's about , like works consciousness an adult , we know this .
Theority and consciousness adult look a little bit more like light flashlight .
The adult , when you decides that something 's relevant or important , pays attention to it .
Our becoming aware of the things that we 're doing , it becomes extremely clear and living and everything else , were dive into darkness .
And we know it 's also something about how that brain does .
When we give attention , cortex face- lobe , efficient part of our brain , sends signal that 's a little part of our brain going to do much adaptable , face one , better in learning and off activity in the rest of the brain .
So we have a very , very focused , the targeted kind of attention .
When we look at the babies and small children , we see something else .
I think that 's babies and little kids have more lantern perception , than a battery perception .
I mean they 're very bad in focus is only one thing .
But they 're very good at picking the amount of information from many different sources at the same time .
If you look at their brain , you 'll see that they 're flood neurotrans that be incentivized learning and faceness , and restrictive part of you haven 't work .
When we tell that babies and little kids don 't paying attention , actually they don 't know , it doesn 'ting attention .
It doesn 't to end all interesting things to them could say something , and watch what it 's important .
This kind of attention , consciousness , would we expected from butterflies that are created to learning .
If we were adults wanted in put into our consciousness child , I think , the best is to imagine new situation , in which we 've never been — if you fall in love with into someone new , or when we first in the new city .
Our consciousness to then , but we don 't really , so the three days in Paris seem to be fuller perception and experiences like months , during which we go , talking andallys sits from thebie .
And by the way , the coffee , the great coffee that you drink down , actually mimics the effect of child neurotransmitters .
So what 's be a child ?
It 's like to be in love , first in Paris , after three doubled espress .
( Laughter ) It 's a great building , but threatened you , that I 'clock in the morning , you 'll build with crying . ( Laughter )
It 's good to be adults .
I don 't mean too much to talk to me about how great are babies .
It 's good to be adults .
We can own on strings and to walk across the street .
And it 's right that we spend a lot of effort to a kids thought like we do .
But if we 're going to be like butterflies , have open mind , to learn , to stopness , creativity , innovation at least sometimes , we should start thinking more as children .

And I 'm going to tell you a story about how I became battlefields against HIV / AIDS .
This is my campaign — SING .
46664 is a number Mandela asmate on the island Robbin Island .
That 's me and Youssou N 'Dour onstage , and he 's .
The next day invited all artists to Mandels left to Robbin Island , where he had press conference here for journalists from all over the world in front of her one-ened a prisoner 's all .
On the window you see bars .
For all of us it was a powerful moment .
That 's when Mandela said the world 's print , that his country eating realed the genocide that immediately after the fall of and separattheaeda in the so-called " " ah . " " Be nations " " a thousand people a day die and that the main victims of it , the most vulnerable s , are women and children .
I 'm very affected , because I 'm a woman and mother , until I realized that the pandemic of HIV / AIDS like this directly affects women .
This is what I 've got to serve . " " So ever since I attended on every single action foundations 46664 , if it was possible , and I 've press conference , interviews , talk and used their status singer , as I promised Mandel , of respects to his a giant an incredibly work that performed .
Nelson Mandela respects the world . " " Nelson Mandela every weighs .
I got to know cutting it into action foundations 46664 .
He was a t-shirt , what I 'm wearing now .
It 's tool . I 'm telling you that I salt dirna with people who have HIV , with people who live with HIV .
And because it 's basicallytigma , these three . I say , " " Yes , we can talk about it .
I don 't be a secret . " " I became members of a Treatment Andaction Camppaign and I 'm proud that I 'm a member so amazing organizations .
It 's campaign in low level and 80 percent members are women , most of which is HIV- oppositeive .
They work in the ground .
They have education programs .
It 's showing on the problems this tigers .
Their job is remarkable .
This is my campaign SING .
Where it 's a SING basically arranging me and about 3 or 4 great people who help me .
The last two and a half years I travel throughout the world . " " I was in about 12 different countries .
Here I 'm in the Osloan and takes overm nice , fat check . Here singing in Hongcong and I 'm trying to raise money .
This is a Scottish Parliament .
And this is in Edinburgh , I 'm with great African child choir , which I love .
Many kids like these axisreed , because their family hit the virus HIV .
I 'm so Powered their position , and it 's expanding my horizon .
The message , this program now send into the world , is : by 2015 we want to become witnessed the whole end the transmission of virus of mother in a child .
It 's a very ambitious goal , but I do believe that with political will is to haveable .
Here I build with woman , which is HIV- oppositeive , kicks we 're smiling , because we have a big self trust . We know is that this young woman was medicinal to living longer and could look after the child who give birth .
It 's a prevention at the very beginning of life .
It 's one of the ways of anti- pandemic of AIDS .
I 'd like to ended now by telling you a little story about Avelile .
This is Avelile . I wages with me everywhere .
It 's a story I 'm talking to everyone , because embodies one of million Irrt because of HIV / AIDS .
Mother Avelile had virus HIV . She died on the disease to called AIDS .
The virus was even Avelile , born with him .
Here is 7 years and does not value more like a-year-old .
In that time , suffered on an advanced disease AIDS and had pneumonia .
And we knew it in the hospital in Eastern Cape and spent with her whole before afternoon , was the gold .
Doctors and nurses were great .
And they gave her very a special nutritional diet and great taking care of her .
The five months later we to South Africa back to Avelile again contacted . "
There was a this change .
I get it that this change you appreciate .
So I 'd like to say , anyone of you : If you think every mother and every child has a right to the world 's a good food , and good medical attention and if you believe that millennium development goals by the U.N. , especially goals five and six , should decide enforced all governments all over the world , especially in sub-Saharan Africa , please , stop .

Fifty years ago , in Smetan network , the engineers undercover walking a major subject through abandoned landscape .
With this hoping in the summing the interest in minds people around the world that are projected to become the first , which humbling universe .
You was huge .
And her the tip hiding the silver sphere with two transmitters inside .
4 . October , 1957 was their rocket launched .
" One of the Russian scientists he wrote : " " Are we in front of creating a new planets , which we 'll call Sputnik . "
In ancient days , , explorers , like Vasco da Gama andColumbus had large happiness in exploring the Earth .
Now we 're lucky we have discover universe .
" " in the future we will be the env hitting our joy . " " Are you with snippets of " " Sputnik , " " my fifth documentary film that is almost finished . "
We talk story Sputnik , and the story about what has happened with America .
In just a few days after release , was Sputnik wonderful interesting .
One person made visible month for ordinary people awakened awe and pride about that person finally release object into space .
But by about three days later , the day called " The Red Monday , us media and politicians said , " " and we were believed that Sputnik was proof that our enemies used in science and technology , and we 're now can to hack your hydrogen bombs , to use rockets Sputnik as the intercontinental ballistic missiles .
We distracted a hellhole .
Sputnik shall soon became one of three shattering event for America — historians its employ to Pearl Harber or 9 / 11 .
" that 's called " "ssle gasp . " "
Weaping race , an arms race .
They started space race .
And over the course of the next year the congress fully funded the enormous increase in the number of guns and we 've gone from 12,500 nuclear guns to 20,000 .
The ones on the Sputnik far away for achieve just increase in the number of guns .
For example , some of of you will remember this day , a 1958 , a nationaled exercise civilianal defense , when tens of million people in 78 cities went underground .
Or survey opinion that found that seven of 10 Americans believed that the quickly and then war and that at least 50 percent of the populations .
But Sputnik 's also out of great change .
For example , some in this room got scholarship on height because of Sputnik .
The support system techniques , math and science — learning as such a — rapidly grows .
And the Vin Cerfs out that Sputnik led directly to AndRPA and to the Internet , and of course NASA .
My document shows free company can be outd those who can use the media .
But also shows how can we change what first looks like a bad situation , in something that was finally very beneficial for America .
" Sputnik " " they 're going to be " " was released . "
So in conclusion , I 'd like to use moment on the thanking one of my investors : the patient TEDster , Jay Walkes .
In addition , I want to thank all of you .

Thank you , Chris .
Hi . So magic is an amazing way as we would still have a reality , do today possible what science tomorrow turns on a reality .
As cyber-r headman relate elements illusions and science , to tell you the allowed to experience technologies the future .
" course heard about the Google eyeliars " "Project Glass . " "
It 's a new technology . When you measure , through the world around you is widespread about data : names cities , remembers , buildings , one day maybe about the names of strangers who you spend on the street .
This is my inonistic glasses .
They 're a little bit large , it 's even just a prototype .
When you 're through , giving you a little insight to mind a cyber illusionionist .
So to show you what I mean .
We just need the play card . It could be any .
So . And it it , so that we 'd recognize it , when we 'll see it again .
All right . Very important brand .
Now let 's it into package , somewhere in the middle , and let 's begin .
( Music ) Voice : Now , ready . The counting image .
Marco Tempest : For those of you who don 't play cards — deck of cards is made up of the four colors : the heart , cross , and the drinks .
Kares are among the earliest symbols and their meaning liv different be misinterpreted .
Some would argue that four color are the four seasons .
Jar , summer , autumn and — Voice : My favorite -year period 's winter . LT : Yeah , my also .
The winter is like magic . It 's time change , heat it converts in winter , water for snow , and then it 's all it 's gone .
And it 's office is from every color 13 cards . ( Music ) Voice : Each card represents one of 13 stage lunar cycle .
MT : So here 's the , here 's a tide and in the middle 's a month .
Voice : the moon is one of the most wrenching symbols magic .
MT : In a deck of cards are other two colors .
The red and the black , which are constantly for changes of the day and night .
Voice : Marco , I had no idea of that you can do it . ( Laughter ) LT : And is perhaps accident that in office is 52 cards , just as it is in 200 52 weeks ?
( Music ) Voice : If we count all points on the cards in a result is , 365 .
MT : Oh , 365 , so it 's days in the year , so many days is between every birthday .
It 's asked . (-ps ) Voice : It didn 't tell what , because it didn 't .
MT : In fact , it was just on my in six birthday , when I got their first deck of cards and you 've since I travel around the world , and I 'm doing a magic for boys and girls , men and women , husbands and husbands , even for the kings and queens . ( Applause ) Voice : And who is this ? MT : Oh , aunct . Look .
Wake up .
I 'dler : In . MT : Are you ready to go a ride ?
I 'dler : Ready ! MT : So show , what can you do .
I 'dler : So I 'll give you my bar to jumping . MT : Yea . Mind .
I 'dler : Whoa , whoa , in , oh ! ( Music ) MT : But today I 'm doing performance for other audience .
For you .
Voice : The called cardsized . MT : Sometimes people ask me how to become magician ? " " You 've got to work from 9 to 5 ?
Okay , it 's not ! You need to train 24 / 7 .
I don 't mean literally 24 hours , seven days a week .
24 / 7 , is now a bit hyperbolic , but to many train . Somebody can say that magic is the work of some wrong superns forces . " " ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Music ) Whoa .
There 's always just say , there 's not .
The Germans does notin unin , which is the English nine nine . ( Laughter ) The magic is not so scary . But I 've got to warn you , if you 're going to play with somebody who 's given cards like this , just don 't bit of money .
( Music ) Voice : Why ? That 's very good cards .
Shan , their mixess is the four 165 :1 .
MT : Yeah , but I think I have better cards . We had statistics .
Voice : I think that you dolo a birthdayk wish . MT : And so us remained just last , but most important of all cards : card with very important brand .
And unlike the everything that 's what we 've just seen , whether it 's virtually or not . Voice : O called cardsized .
The digitalal MT : That 's definitely the real .
MT : Bye . ( Music ) Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause ) ( Applause )
I would like to show you something that I actually worked .
During these 30-de challenges I 've learned a few things .
This was part of challenge , something taking a picture of every day in one month .
I never had the courage to found
It 's terrible .
On the contrary , it 's been great fun .
( Applause )
Hi . So I 'd like to share with you a couple of things that I 'm working .
Since on those work still we 're working , to a large extent we move in the area intuitions and mystery .
I 'll try to write some of the experience that each of these piece 're trying to do .
So the first piece is Imperialed Mohses .
That 's unsuspecting viewers enter into the room and notice those panels , liked composition on a wall .
In a few seconds as if panels notice the present viewer , it looks like that , started sli and reseting a strictly symmetrrically .
( Laughter ) This is a diagram two conditions .
The first is total chaos . The second whole order .
So we wondered , how little you can transition from one state to another .
This remind us a two very different art tradition .
First , there 's aboutary pills of the 15th century , the second one comes about a 100 years . Malevich 's abstract composition .
So let me show you a video .
To give you a sense of the real scales , the greatest of panels that 's about two meters high .
About this much . And the least it is the size of A4 .
So viewers into meesness , and now they 're in attention .
And after a while , if viewers remains in room , panels become against his present in a room themennys , and they get again autonomous again , until they can 't the present or movement , and then again stand up to watch .
( Laughter ) Here 's what it looks like , that viewers like caused order between panels , but it could be a vice versa . Maybe are panels so used onto their pre- intended behaviors , they viewer in the role of forcing tyrann .
This brings me to the quieter , smallerm piece of named Handdheld .
Audiences see a piece of paper located on a wall on the other side of the room , but when you get close , he sees that it 's empty letter A4 or empty letterprint that on each side of keeping two little hands cut from a small piece of wood into the smallest details and with high attention .
Audience sees also that this whole sculpture moves very slowly , like these two hands tried to hold onto paper in place a long time , and they don 't quite well .
So this unstability movement very significantly reminds me of volatility image that we see through ru start camera .
Here you 're going to two footage .
One of the firmly located cameras , and the second of by handy cameras .
And now you can see , like translity of this video shows the presence view and subjective perspective .
So we just eliminated camera and shifting this movement to panel .
So here 's the video . "
We need to imagine other hand . And there 's not .
We 're trying to do but asing gesture self-mas like for this giant piece of paper was someone withst hands .
This is from havinging serve observer and very delictly this piece of paper from them present the observer .
The next piece is Decos .
This is a cardboard model , so the object is about so high like me .
" " " round body , two hands , and a very highs of " " " " place head , and it 's the only goal is attract attention to themselves . "
So when it came along the viewers , starts to avert from side to side and hands , moving faster and faster , the more viewers approaches .
So this is the first test .
You can see two movements together , and the object is trying to the resolution of despair involved all their being .
The bottom line but is that when attention viewer , it lose interest in starts to find someone else .
( Laughter ) This is finished body Decos .
It looks mass manufactured , like from the factory , like vacuum cleaners or washing machines .
Because we 're working from always very personal space , we like , as this useed aesthetics to some extent deperson out the whole pieces and provide us the same since its appearance .
This is the sameoused being that tries to , to you from the things that your attention really need , but can it be a creature that very needed help .
The next piece is object that 's also a musical instrument .
In shape andmphithestra who is designed to meet a size audience of someone 's on the stage .
So where I 'm standing , each one of you looks like this big , and whole audience covers all my visual field .
In audience sitting 996 small characters .
They 're equipped to could from a place of empowerment clapping .
This means that each and every one of them may decide , when he wants clap , how hard , and as long as they want to be aed other or their to influence , and whether they want to participate in innovations .
So when viewers enter a audience , gets response .
It could be weak or strong ( Applause ) , and then nothing happens until viewers leaven stage , and audience again respond .
The ones can be anything from fainted the Applause of several members of the audience or very intense .
So for us , this means that we 're looking at the audience as a separate thing , like own organism that has an almost musical properties , like musical instrument .
Audience on it , what might play you appealing fairly complex and disparate musical or auditory patterns , but it can 't audience directly to elicited to any particular reaction .
Died containing the same rate of the rating , unpredicness and I don 't comforts .
I mean , in a way try and paste .
As you can see , this us quite excited image head divideating to forms two hands .
Here 's a little visual animation , like both side they brought the brain and were trying to understand theality of and tensions .
And here 's the prototype .
We don 't get into Wait a minute , when their we have 996 .
OK , this is the final piece . S called Ferrnners .
It comes from the principle of window .
This is a real window in our study , and as you can see , before it wooden parts of three different latitudes .
So we took the same language window to create own frame , which is hanging in a room that you can see from these two sides .
The tribes with little characters .
It also are three different sizes , to inferred perspective or the distribution of on one 's flat .
Each of these characters can also go forward ora in a hide and the two go outside .
So unlike this very narrow frame , we these characters they wanted to make aics , almost bizarre , if someone were to take them and physically moved from place to place .
And I love the idea to us these characters jump uped , though their nothing don 't worry aboutil , like they were happy and well-d until you don 't awareness movement viewer andy cover the next of .
For us this piece is something even conflict .
These characters are trapped in this very powerful frame that reminds me of a prison , but also its strength , because it 's nothing to them , don 't worry about it , to be naive and almost didn 't know anything about the world around them .
So all of these characteristics that I 'm talking , they 're turned into very specific of technical configuration , and we 've had the honor at making the first prototype to work with ETH Zurich .
So , as you can see , of our animations eliminated aboutzubing movement and created a kind of movement that involvedations head and movement roll back and forth .
So it 's a fairly small .
You can see that I walks into hands .
So imagine how we got excited , when we 've seen this really work . Here 's it .
( Laughter ) Thank you !
( Applause )
" And my initialed the conclusion was that that 's simply a better people .
I can 't two people on having worked .
But that feeling of where did it come from ?
That 's personal .
And when we feel safe , so natural reaction was trust and cooperation .
It 's in the night I caning and trust that someone from a guard danger in front of me .
And these forces you don 't have no control .
" " Why is treating with us as a time ? " "
" " Why can 't deal with us than the people ? " " " And she said exactly this : " "
but it 's that don 't have the fear of their leaders .
It 's not about those numbers .
It 's because violated the very nature leadership .
We violated the deepest rooted social principles .
Great leaders would neverd people because of the numbers .
They sacrifice for us their blood , sweat and tears to vision their a leader , filled . And when ask them , " " Why did you do that ? " "
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
I grew up in the Limpopo , on the border of provinces in the Limpopo and Mpumdangs in a little town called Motetema .
Vodable resources and resources electricity are so dotable , like weather . I grew up in these circumstances , and it 's , like , when I was 17 , healed some friends in winter and suned .
The sun in the Limpopo can be in winter , there 's very hot .
Now as you sun , my best friend next to me says , " " Listen , why someone doesn 't think something that just to , at skin , and you don 't batheing ? " " And I look , and I said , " " So would I also I bought . " " I went home , and I did you smaller survey . I found very shocking statistics .
We now has over 2.5 billion people in the world a access to water ands hygienic precautions .
450 million of them are living in Africa and five million of them lives in South Africa .
In environments like are breeding different kinds of diseases , and it 's the most powerful 's called the eachome .
Trasome is aboutal an infection from geeks , which it finds its way into an eye . Morefold infections theomes can lead to a permanent blind .
This disease senses blinds eight million people every one year . Shocking about that is to avoids the infectionsome , you can I washed you face . It no drugs , no pills , no an injection to someone .
who look like secret recipe for an amazing KFC 's .
" So I said , " " the recipe , we have finished .
Now we have to give him into practice .
For we hop four years — after I wrote 40-page business model on my mobile phone , and after I wrote on it also patent , I youngest pe patent in the country , and — " " no buying . " " ) — I don 't have to what to add . ( Laughter ) I made my DryBath , first sk milk that replace buying .
They literally ony on skin , and you don 't have bathe it .
( Laughter ) After I tried it in practice in high school with limited resource , I went to university , I met my few people , has put into practice product and now there 's a fully functional up-and- product that 's ready for listing to market . In fact , it 's available on the market .
So we 've learned a few pours about tradeing and about how people available Dryth . "
Amongst other things , we found that poor communities don 't buy products at large .
They buy products by needs . People from Alex of allut package of cigarettes , but rather one cigarette every day , even if it 's more expensive .
So Dry 're selling ;th in a differentery ,s .
Just turn them in half and print .
And the best part is that one , how will replace the one bathroom for five wounds .
We make this model , we 've learned a lot about implementation product .
And we found that even rich kids a suburbs really want DryBath . ( Laughter ) At least once a week .
In any case , we found that could save on average 80 nice . liters of water every time , when youy bathrooms , and also we could save two hours a day to children who are living in rural areas — about two hours more on school , about two hours more on homework , about two hours more be just a child .
When we understand this global impact , reduced our key claims to clean and comfort .
DryBath is comforted for rich and rescue of life for the poor .
What keeps you ? " " ( Applause ) Now I don 't stop there . Now I don 't stop there .
The other interesting thing that I learned during all over this process . Last year me Google named in one of the mosttaentest person in the world .
Now , I also studies the best business in the world , the first African that got so honors , but the one thing that has really a , it 's that all I did just because they did not want me buying . Thank you .
( Applause )
So with this focusing on lower costs I asked myself , forget the patient ?
It 's a big part of the national 's budgets .
And a lot of different kinds of reforms tries to this growth foring .
" In other countries not consequence new drugs , and therefore they can 't get to patients .
In a few countries are doctors and nurses to some extent for Parliament .
And fancy decisions in health care then do doctors and nurses .
We would you prefer expensive laboratoryak test , you decide that you 'll operate an old and weakened patient .
So the limiting freedom of doctors can maintain low costs .
Finally , some doctors today , and they say they don 't have a perfect freedom to make decisions , which they think are the right for their patients .
So we went back , and we said , " " What 's actually what we 're trying to do ? " "
We call this the health care based on their values .
This was described beautifully in 2006 in a book that wrote Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
In this picture , you can see my mother-in-laws with their three beautiful daughters .
If you compare hospital in a country , you discover that some are extremely good , but also you 'll find lots and lots of those that are substantially worse .
The differences were dramatic .
Ho come you coin . 50 percent risk . That 's quite a lot of it .
If instead , went into the Hamburg , to the clinic called Martins-K clinic , same thing risk would be a 1 :20 .
But you and I don 't know . We don 't have information .
And often these data or don 't exist .
Nobody knows .
So to go to the hospital is like lottery .
But doesn 't have to be like this . It 's hope .
On the left here you see the variations metal parts , artificial bestder that you used to someone who needs new hip .
" " " Hmm , we should measure this . " " " " No , we should measure this . " "
And since agreed , start with measuring , and they began to share this information .
Everybody saw that that makes sense .
Since then , published every year .
Once a year publish ligation spreadsheet , who is the very best , who 's at the bottom of the ladder ?
And each other visit to learn , so it 's ongoing cycle of improving .
It this principle it seems really exciting .
Doctors come together , the back to what is good quality , they 's measure , then share information , fromist , who is the very best , and learn from .
You don 'twined improvement .
But , this is not the only exciting part .
That 's exciting in itself .
So when you look at the story about is plant 's hip , sometime ago , was worked study , where were compared the U.S. and Sweden .
We worked studies , where we focus on data from OECD .
OECD makes once a time studies focus on the quality of care , where they 're finding information in all the male member states .
That 's 20 percent of the budgets up on health care in the country .
We were always the best in the classroom .
But most of them don 't .
But physicians have another thing .
They recognize theing from the fellows .
If a cardiologist else call cardiologist in another a competing hospital and speak about why the second hospital has a much better results , the stories .
They separate the information , how to improve .
It 's measuring and creating transparency cycle of the environment we 're constantly improving to what it shows this picture .
So you might say , well , this is a good idea , but this is not just the idea .
This really happens .
You might think it sounds like sneeze , but it 's not that sneeze , it 's a shortcut .
It 's a shortcut for International of for measuring results in health care .
And next year plan to do eight disease , and a year later , 16 .
Why is that ?
That 's the day I sat a workshop with doctors , nurses , and another career staff and said we 're about child leukemia .
A group discuss how now of we turn quality .
We can measure better than we do that today ?
Disk we how to treat these children , what are the important improvements .
In a room was an enormous energy .
It 's many ideas and so many enthusiasm .
looked at the group and said — first picked up a hand , I forgot — raised their hand , they 'real a group , and then he said , " " Thank you . "
Thank you .
I 'm really excited to be able to tell you about a few really surpriseing findings for the what brings companies success and that factors have in the success of startups largest weight .
That 's what I wanted to figure out .
First of all , the idea .
I used to think that idea is everything .
One of our first successes Citysearch came , when people wanted to the website .
" Go.com that we reported to TED in 1998 , came , when companies are looking for effectively increase visits .
that 's a great idea , great the timing of .
YouTube at the beginning had no business model .
And the best way to find the right , it 's look at it , or are consumers really ready to what you want to offer .
Very thank you , you 've been a great audience .
( Applause )
So I went to share with you my photographing .
Or it 's not photos of ?
Because this is of course picture that with his cameras don 't .
Despite my interest in photos of started , when I got the first digital camera in 15 years .
It 's you , it 's with my earlyed passion for painting , but it 's a bit different , because by using camera , the manufacturing process is in planning .
And when you do with our cameras photograph of process ends , when presses the person behind the trigger .
I felt like photos of was more about to be at the right time and the right place .
I got the feeling that could do anyone .
So I wanted to create something different , something where process begins when presses the person behind the trigger .
Fos like this : work to busy journey .
But it 's of short .
And yet it 's as a certain level of reism .
Or photos like this — the dark and colorful , but all with speak a common goal keep level of reism .
When I 'm talking aism , I mean photo-realism .
Because it 's of course it 's not something you normal could capture , but always want to it looked like , that 's some way could be captured like the photograph .
Fos , where you 'll need moment to revealed the trick .
So it 's more about represents idea than about represents moment .
But what 's trick is used that it looked realistics ?
It 's some details or colors ?
It 's light ?
What makes the illusion of ?
Sometimes it 's an illusion of perspective .
Finally , goes about how we interpret the world and as can be caught on two-dimensional surface .
In fact , it 's not about what 's real , it 's about what we think it looks realistic .
So I think the basics are pretty simple .
And it 's just , I see as puzzle reality , where you can take a different parts of reality and put them together so that you create an alternative reality .
I 'll show you a simple example .
We 've got three perfectly imagined physical objects , that are us a three-dimensional world very well-known .
But when their combine certain ways , can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could be .
But also , we know that can 't .
So we 'reed our minds , because our brains simply don 't accepting the fact that it actually doesn 't make sense .
And the same process I see also combineing images .
It 's really just the mixing different rest .
That 's what makes photographs realistic , , for me , are the things that we don 't think it 's not , things that surround us in our daily lives .
But when you combine photography , it 's very important to take on it about , because otherwise it 's just looks some wrong .
So I said , that there are three basic rules , how realistic achieve the outcome .
As you can see , these images are not very strange .
But when you recombining , can create something that looks like that .
So , the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
Second , combined photos should have the same kind of light .
And these two images both those conditions fill up withing — in the same altitude and the same light .
A third is about to do so that it 's impossible to recognize , where different images start , and end by transition will be are vertical .
" He couldn 't tell you how picture actually was created .
So adapting color , contrast and I move on shores between different images the future by adding photographic effects like depth sharpness , tenurated color and noise , blur the boundaries between various images , and it 's going to look like one image , yet one image that can contain basically , hundreds of layers .
Here 's another example .
( Laughter ) Somebody could think that it 's just a picture countries and changed 's just the bottom time .
But this picture is in fact all folded of photographs of different areas .
Personally , I think that 's easier than to find a place to build it , because then you don 't have to do trade-offs with ideas that you have .
But it 's a lot of planning .
And so , I got this idea in the winter , I knew that I have a few months , the planning , for finding different locations for parts , from which will image .
So for example , this fish was taken to go fish .
" " This are you from different locations .
The recipe of was captured in stoneols .
And yes , even a house on top of island to colored in red , to look more Swedish .
So , to get to the realistic outcome of a , you have to , I think , particularly plan .
You always starts sketch , ideas .
And then it 's about the mixing different images .
And here 's each and every piece of very well planned .
If you 're doing a good job to makeed photos , then can be the result of a beautiful , and also very real .
All the tools to do this are there , and the only thing that limits us , is our imagination .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : Welcome , Julian .
They say that WikiLeaks , your baby , in a few the last years posted more classified documents than other world media together .
Is it even possible ?
Julian Andssanage : Yeah , it 's even possible ?
There 's fear that the rest of the world 's media doing a bad work that one a small group of activists is able to post more information this type , than all the press in the world .
CA : So how does this work ?
As humans , post the documents ?
And as you 're protect their privacy ?
JA : It 's , if we know , classical to bring . And we have for them many ways of information to get to us .
We use modern encryption to actually transport things to the Internet , they 's feet , and we 're using legal jurisduction , like in Sweden , and Belgium was , to achieving the legitimate protection .
Information we get email , a common mail , encrypted or not , for believe them as a two- press agency , the format of them — which is sometimes a hard thing to do when it comes to a giant database of information — post them to the public , and then it 's a fights 's inevitablable legals and political attacks .
CA : So you 're trying to deliver that documents legitimateed . But , in fact , almost never know identity source .
JA : Yes . We know it very rarely has . And even when it into know , so the information destroying the earlier .
( Anving phone ) Sa hell .
( Laughter ) CA : I think CIA asks the code for membership when at TED . " ( Laughter )
So , take the example .
This is something that you 've made a few years ago .
If it shows ...
So this was in Kenya a few years ago .
You can tell us what you 're made and what happened ?
JA : This is the report agency Kroll .
It 's a secret news information services that you 've ordered Kenyan government after the election in 2004 .
A year ago in Kenya4eigned Daniel andrap Mos about 18 years old .
It 's a subtle dictator .
" And when the Kibki got some power — because of theitions forces that have tried to take out in Kenya corruption — ordered you this message , and paid for her , and one of the messages , two million pounds .
And then they got the government , and they 've used to political pressure on Moy , who was still there , the rich , and I 'm a man in Kenya .
It 's the holy grail firm to journalism .
So here I was in 2007 , and we 've managed it hold just before the election — 28 . December .
Well , we publish the three days after , how a new president Kibki decided to get together with the men , who wanted to get , Daniel andrap Mos . So this news has become a burden for President Kibki .
CA : And to cut a long story short , theness about this messages in Kenyan of official , but there 's indirect . And your view it influenced choice .
JA : Yes . We find on the front side of the Guardian and then in all countries neighboring with Ke mold , in the tentzaian and South Africaic printing .
And so the outside of received in .
And after a couple of days to write about it without fear could they press .
20 days ran in a firm television , and by firm to information services affected 10 percent voices that changed the results of voting .
CA : So your occur really significantly changed the world ?
JA : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : And now you 're going to play a briefly excerpt from this videom into the Baghdad .
The actual video is longer . But here 's a little clip .
It did tells , it 's a compelling material .
" " S : ... as their strengthsari , shooting . "
I see goal , the car , about four terings , h , with ...
Can you . OK , shooting .
Take know to their it gives you . They . "
And it 's on me to them .
Well , to love !
(reice of machine guns ) Theyj . Theyj . (reice of machine guns ) They . "
Hotel ... " " The kids two-ness , " " The kids two-ness , " "
to go , now !
Okay , what we 're all eight the person .
I see two birds (ing helicopters ) and still shooting .
Roger , I 've got them .
Two-s , here 's two-s , go .
Oops , perdon . " " What 's been ?
Sar , Kyle . Okay , hahaha , I got them .
CA : What 's had an impact ?
JA : The people who worked on it strong .
We ended up toying two people to the Baghdad , to about found more .
This is just the first of the three attacks that 's happened .
CA : this attack 11 people died , including the two employees Reuters , right ?
JA : Yes , Two employees Reuters and two kids were wounded .
And there were killed 18 to 26 people .
CA : And occur this prompted general outrage .
What do you think was the key element that actually sparked the outrage ?
JA : I don 't know , I think people can see the disparit forces .
You have people who relax go down the street and then a helicopter Apache , the kilometers shooting from them 30-millimeter charges after all , looking for the memory , and kills people to protecting wounded .
And there were two journalists who obviously they weren 't stops , because this is their work .
CA : And American andt secrets service , Bradley Manning , was arrested . And in looking to admit that give you this video with 280,000 secrete telegrams the U.S. Embass .
He did that ?
JA : The up we accept those telegrams .
About five days ago was accused from reaching 150,000 telegrams and releasing the 50 .
In the early 200 we publish the telegram U.S. Embassy , in Reykjavi . But it with necessarily 's disconnect .
I was known visit the embassy .
CA : If you get thousands of diplomatical telegrams the U.S. Embass ...
JA : The public we would changed . " " ( " " ? ) JA : Yes . ( CA : Why ? ) JA : Because these things revealing real state , for example , the Arab government , their real abuse human rights .
If you look at the fromcovered telegrams , there 's these materials .
CA : So let 's a little bit more careful .
More generally , what 's your philosophy ?
Why is right to support making them public classified information ?
JA : There 's the question , what information is the world 's important , and how information can make changes .
There 's a lot of information .
So when organization investing in toing some information , it 's a good sign , that when information gets out , may be helpful . Because organizations that know them best and that know them from inside , you put effort , to their toed .
And that 's what we found from practice . " " And so it 's the essence of journalism . "
CA : But there 's risk , whether it 's for an individual person , or the entire company that escape may have unintended consequences ?
JA : The anything that we 've made it , we didn 't .
We 've got their principles protection .
We have a way to store with information that contain personal — the information about a particular person .
But there 's fair secrets — like your medical record , that are fair secrets . But we is we deal with to hangers who are well motivated .
CA : So there 's a good motivation .
" CA : What would you say , for example , the parents , which — son serves in the U.S. military , and which says , " " You know what , you 're made something that someone wanted to release . "
( Video ) shows American soldier who laughs , as people die .
That raises the sense in millions of people around the world , that American soldiers weren 't fairly .
" That 's not true . My son isn 't . How da you ? " " What would you say ? "
JA : That we hear quite often .
But remember that people in Baghdad , Iraq , Afghanistan — they don 't need to see 's a video ; they 's see every day .
So it doesn 't change their opinion . They don 't 's their impression .
That 's what they see every day .
They 's impression and opinion people who for everything pay . And that 's our hope .
CA : So you have figured out a way to light up on things that you would see as aing the secrets of companies and government .
The light 's good .
But you can see the iron that to you in to light up , you musting themselves to their resources ?
JA : Even not . We have no WikiLeaks dissidents .
We don 't have the resources that are dissides against other sources .
If this was discovered , it would be a complex situation for us . But news we to people had felt moral obligation to continue to our mission , so you 're not broken .
CA : But what would interest , just on what we 've heard — I 'm curious to view in the audience TED .
You know , there might be moreered opinions on WikiLeaks and Juliaa .
For example , it 's hero , which bring us important light .
Or dangerousaker , an .
Who thinks that 's hero ?
And who that is a dangerousaker , an ?
JA : Well so . Somebody sure is .
CA : They 're soft , Julian , softs .
We have more to do . " " And they 's another example .
Here 's something that you 're still doesn 't believe the right now , but you do for TED .
It 's fascinating story that just became , right ?
" What is that ?
JA : This is an example of what we 're doing about every day .
So last year — in November last year — was a series of eruptions in Albania , as was explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , but not so big .
And we got a message — something like technical analysis of what happened — to say that protects the audrenal oil companies there fored trucks and dispos them into the air .
And that 's involved and part of albian government , and so on , and so on .
And this technic news didn 't have anyhead . So that was for us extremely hard document .
We couldn 't verify it , because we didn 't know who he wrote it and who knew what 's .
So we were skeptical , whether it 's not a play a competing oiled society .
" So , we 've made and said , " " this things we have doubts . "
I don 't nothing , but what can we do ?
" materials , operates good right , but we can 't verify it . " " And we got letter just this week from company , which he wrote it , and they wanted to track down resource . ( Laughter ) They said , " " We want to find source . " " And we 're from said , " " Tell us more . "
It 's like documentary 's just you say ?
You can tell us to show that you have a lawed right ?
" It really your ? " " So we sent this slide of screens with author in identifier applications Microsoft World . "
Yeah .
( Applause ) This happens a lot .
This is one of our method identifiation — testing material . That 's how we find people who the leaves they 're writing .
CA : You 're information from the inside BP ?
JA : Yeah , we have their enough , but I don 't we solve seriously financial and technical things .
So we 're in the last couple of months , a little reduce published , while we create the system for a phenomenal interested in public .
That 's problem .
As each nurturing startup organization , we just overwhelmed own progress . ' What it means is that we get the enormous amount of very important information from the bears , but we don 't have enough people to them with modern world .
CA : So this is the hurdle all journalistan volunteers and / ; or funding journalistan pays ?
JA : Yeah , and trusts people .
We 're organization that it 's hard to develop quickly because of a kind of material that we 're working . So we 're a we restructure naturalize to have people who will work on questions national security , and then the less serious things .
CA : Tell us something about themselves , and about how you 're getting to that .
I think I read that as a child you 're going into 37 different schools .
It could be true ?
JA : Well , my parents were in the film industry , and escaping a section , so the combination of these two ...
( Laughter ) CA : Psychoologist might say , it 's a formula for paran developments .
JA : What , film industry ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : " " And you also were , the hackers and almost you turned with authoritys .
JA : Well , I 'm a journalist .
You know , I was very young journalist and an activist
I was cover magazine , and for him to me as a teenager investigated .
" So you have to be careful with the word " "hacker . " "
It 's a method that can be used in various different ways .
Unfortunately , that 's are most us in the Russianian mafied to steal the bank in your grandmothers .
So this phrase is not to as nice as I used to be .
CA : Certainly I don 't think you steal bank the grandmother 's not . But what your basic values ?
You can tell us to suggest what are the and maybe some incidentt in your life , which toed for their intendia ?
JA : I 'm not sure about the incident .
But fundamental values : able , generous people victims , they don 't take care of them .
And it 's something from my dad and something from other capable and generous people who have been in my life .
CA : Schoping , generous people victims ; they don 't take care of victims ?
JA : Yes , I see person , so take care of people don 't know . But some way — There 's a different way of der about victims , and it 's to punishsers of crime .
And it 's something that I 'm in their constitution for a long time .
CA : So we quickly tell one more story : what happened to Island ?
Something you publish the there , they find themselves in trouble with bank , and news services there ban publishing it .
Instead , published your side .
So you 've Island high profile . What happen then ?
JA : Yeah , it 's a great case .
Iceland walking financial crisis .
It achieve their worst of all countries in the world .
Their bank sector was 10 times larger than the GDP of the rest of the economy .
The publiced this message in July last year .
" And the state television got ban post it five minutes broadcast . The as in the film , discovered on a table , and moderator messages said , " " is still didn 't . What do I do now ? " "
So instead have shown website broadcasting all the time . " " And we got the Island very famous , we walked in Iceland and talk about it .
In society for did feel that this can never happen . " " And the result of that was that together with some sland friendships politics and other international legals experts built a new laws for Island to become habitats for free press , with the most stronger as journalist 's protecting the world 's a higher price point with Nobel Prize honor to freedom of expression .
Iceland is northn country , so , as in Norway , there 's possible to enter into the system .
And just a month or slandian Parliament lawsy passed .
CA : Great .
( Applause ) Last question , Julian .
And when you think of the future , think it 's more like that Big jurther will have more control , more secret , or the other way , we 're going to actually on Big jurther , or it 's everything finally differently ?
JA : I 'm not sure which way it 's go .
There 's a huge amount of pressure for coordinating laws of freedom a word and transparency around the world — part of the E.U. , between China and the United States .
How 's going to evolve ? That 's very hard to predict .
That 's in today 's very interesting . Because it 's only a small ing we can move one or the other direction .
CA : I think I 'm going even viewers , when I , Julian that to be careful and you 'll say a lot of forces .
JA : Thank you , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
There 's boy who look at my father , and says , " " Dad , when I grew up , I wanted to be by the former President . " " ( Laughter ) How the former President I was very lucky , because I had an opportunity , what had just little people in the world , to know the number of people around the world .
Not only that , I know 50 states in the U.S. , but with my wife I visited more than 145 countries around the world , and Carter Center constantly working with 80 nations the Earth .
So our perpetual commitment in Carter Center is to support human rights , and I know , I know the world like I can tell you without weighting say that the number one in violating human rights abuse on Earth is women and girls what , who know why , we don 't talk a lot .
( Applause ) It 's a few reasons why it 's going on , and I 'm going to start with them .
The first of them is wrong interpretation of religious , a sanctuary sciss , the Bible , Star law , New law , the Koran , and so forth , and these are wrong you founded men who are in significant positions in sonagorgas , churchs and a mosques .
And they have to put these rules to provide that women are confidently in the eyes of God , from harassed on the side of the rail compared to men .
This is a very serious problem . But it 's enough .
Many years ago , in 2000 , I was South the Baptist whole 70 years old — still teaching every Sunday Sunday school ; in Sunday also I 'm going to learn — South convention baptists right in 2000 decided that women have just be the nexton roles , in undervi registration against the man .
So attempteddirection , which basically preventing women to become the priests , pastor , dekans in churchs , or cap plans in the military , and if woman leads the classroom in a seminar of South Baptist , can learn , if it 's in room a boy , because in the Bible rows are , " " in the Bible is over 300,000 lines that say that the woman should have to teach a man and so on .
And the main thing is that sacred script are misinterpreted , to maintain men in the heading position .
It 's ubiquitous problem , because men think they can you imposed this power and if thick husband or employer , for example , wants under it 's women , it can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God , why would I get to them I behave as they equal ?
" Another very relevant disaster , which causes this problem , it 's excessive exposure to us , and that is an immense has been increasing rate of around the world .
For example , in the United States we experience the enormous increase abuse of poor people , mostly black and minority , who were closed into the prison .
When I was administration Goveringer 's Georgie , one of 1,000 Americans sat in prison .
It 's now in prison 73 people from 1,000 .
That 's 7-fold increase .
And since I left B White house , 800-percent reductions has increased the number of black women in prison .
We 're the only from developed countries where it 's still true death sentence .
And we are right next to the countries that are the most ex all forms of human rights , by supporting death sentence .
We 're in California , and recently , I found that California married four billion dollars to execut death sentence in 13 people .
When you do the count , California pay 307 million dollars for the make one person .
Nebraska this week passed the lawated criminal punishment death , because it 's so expensive . ( Applause ) We 're seeing that violence against the poor and helplessed people 's another reason for rise abuse of women .
I want to give you just a couple examples that most frozen , and I 'm going to brief , because , as you know , there 's only a limited time : " "
Abs it 's women 's fear .
Women 's theia is cruel and most American women the unknown , but in some of the countries , in many countries when born into a girl , at a very early age her so-called " "cter " " completely paragraphsed genie brit of in nonstered environment , remove the external parts of female genitalia .
And in some extreme , but not rare , cases , open a girls , " " to justing or menstruaing .
" And later , when married , it 's coming again atter " " and " " open to her ens could have sex .
It 's not even the rare case , although it 's in many countries againsted .
In some countries it 's more than 98 percent of women that were this maimed before the age of adulthood .
This is a severe crime on all the women that living in these countries .
Another abuse , which is in severe rise , it 's murder of honor , caused by bad interpretation , again , a sanctuar writing was — in the Koran isn 't nothing , what would to this encouraged — where family to prepare girl from the family , if was raped or if married to a man she doesn 't , whichated father , or even when it 's appropriate clothing .
And this do members of her own family , so they become in murderers , if girl on family imposs so-called 's shame .
In Egypt U.N. sometime ago , was doing analysis , and that show that 75 percent of these in girls doing father , uncle or brother , but 25 percent of those in do the women .
The other problem in the world that concerns mostly women , is slaveculture , or business with people , as it 's called today .
The Africa to the New World for its about 12.5 million people in slavery in 18 and 19th century .
Today lives in slavery 30 million people .
The Ministry of the U.S. State now got , thet from Congress to once a year was presented in a message , and the Ministry ofins that 800,000 people every year through international boundaries for into slavery , and of those from is 80 percent of women that are sexual slaves horses .
In this moment in the U.S. 60,000 people live in slavery .
In Atlanta in the state of Georgia , where it is Carter Center and where I teach at Emory University , every month for 200 — 300 people like female slaves .
That 's why it 's the first place in the United States .
Atlantic has the largest airport in the world , and it 's also a lot of passport loads , they 're coming from South hemisphere .
If you want the owner a messy place to buy a girl with brown skin , or a black , it can get it for 1,000 dollars .
Girl with white skin brings more than 7 times as much and the average owner a messy place in Atlanta , and the United States today can earn also 35,000 dollars a slaves .
He with sex in Atlanta brings more than all the drugs trade in Atlanta .
So that 's another very serious problem , and the main problem is prostia , because in America doesn 't exist only the brideiner who don 't know , local official , police officers , a police boss or mayor and so forth .
And that leads to one of the worst problems , which is that women are increasingly buyed and sexually introed in all of the countries of the world .
Sweden has to do good approach .
About 15 to 20 years ago , Sweden willing to change law , and women that are in sexual of slavery , are no longer with , but withed are I choirs dels , passports , and the manly customer , and — ( Applause ) — the number cases prostitution decline .
In the United States , we have exactly the opposite approach .
And everybody 's a man tot blowing up for illegal trades with sex seems in the U.S. 25 arrested women .
Canada , Ireland , Sweden , as I said , France and other countries are now toward to this of a Swedish model .
That 's also one of possibilities .
In this country we have two great institutions that all admire : our army , and our great university system .
In the military , just analyzing , to many sexual attacks in it happens .
The last message that I have , that says it 's 26,000 sexual attacks that have become an army . 26 thousand .
It 's them withed only 3,000 , something over one percent , and the reason is , the Comman of any organization — ships like my submarine , or the Bataliion in the military , or crew , a mariners — Comman has lawed right to decide if this violent with , or not , and of course , the last thing that want to , it 's someone knew that under them ineling its of sexual violence , so they don 't keep up .
The law has to change .
About one in four girls that the seconds on American university , facing sexual violence before as degree , and this is a lot of discussion now , partly also because of my book , but also a different , and so 89 university in America was takens from the Ministry of education in terms of law Title IX , because the leading university is taking care about women and letting them a sexual attacks .
The Ministry of Justice says that more than half of rape on campuses high schools do more timesing violent here , because if someone raped outside of university , they 're going withing , but if it makes it to university soils , they can raping needlessly .
These are the manageable .
And these are the things in our society you chronically .
These are things that exists .
In this ladder theest 500 companies is 23 , in which it 's leader woman , 23 of 500 companies , and these CEOs , it doesn 't have to speak , making less than the average of what else directors .
So that 's going on in our country .
The other problem with the United States is the one that we are mostlest nation on Earth .
Since World War II , we have been at war with about 25 different countries .
In some cases , our soldiers directly fought .
Once we 're flying over the heads people and theed them bombs .
Another time , like now , our withouted by the planes infect people .
Since World War II , we have been at war with 25 or more different countries .
They were four years , don 't know that when we — ( Applause ) — when we don 't wasted only bomb , don 't smoke , doesn 't only the rocket shoot a single bullet .
But ones , those kinds of things , exposure to violence and wrong interpretation of it a sanctuary writingm are the main causes abuse of women and girls .
There 's another fundamental reason why don 't have to remember that , and that is , in general is about men do not care about .
( Applause ) It 's so .
The average man , which says that it 's against the abuse of women and girls , and accept privilege that has a position , which is very similar to what I knew as a child , as there were withparing , but yet equals .
Rass discrimination then legally there was 100 years , since 1865 , from Inian of war , over 60 . years old when Lydon Johnson fored laws about the same rights .
But in that moment , there are many white people who didn 't think that race- discrimination 's fine , but they don 't , because I 've been taking a privileges as a better job , unique approach to work the judge , better schools and everything else , and that 's the same , even today , there 's because the average man who , it 's a fact .
Even a says , " " discrimination against women and girls , " "ment you privileged position .
So what the basic thing we have to do today ?
We usual female in Egypt many don 't say about how are her daughters of reved , and so on .
I won 't do or detail to pay .
But I hope that from this conference comes out that every woman that here is , gets his man that they have their daughters ands to protect against abuseing on campuses , in the military , and so and so on , and the labor markets the future .
I have 12 grandchildren , four children and 10children rightt and often at them and I think ontal situations that they face in America , not just if lived in Egypt or somewhere abroad , in human rights , and I hope that all of you will join me , and will proponents of women and girls across the world , and they protecting human rights .
Thank you very much .
When I here at Oxford studied in ' 70s , a future world was without &aposed .
Populaal explosion was stoppviable .
The wholeo explaining faminezz wasn 't .
Epidmy cancer , caused by chemicals in environment , had to with length of our life .
And forests pdal the acid rained .
I told you about from year to year by more than a kilometer or so .
The oil . And we 're spending nuclear winter , with us had to .
None of it , we didn 't . ( Laughter ) And surprisingly , if we look at what is in my life really happened , we 'll find that average income per one average per capita planet is , after outfitted inflation lot of development , has tripled .
D glide life , from my birth increased by 30 percent .
Childhood mortality has come down a factor of about two-thirds .
Production food on a one person has gone up about a third .
And all of this doubled the number of people .
As we do — whether it we for good or bad .
Now how did we do it ?
What 's it , that we are the only species who do the more , the more grows ?
The dot sizes on this diagram , represents the population . " " And his level of GDP per capita .
I think that the answer get , if we realize , as human beings match their brains and allow so combining and forsing ideas , their bringing and crossing .
In other words , we have to realize how ideas are coming .
Imagine , as we from making these objects get to manufacture like this .
Both of them are real objects .
One 's axe of paleoal a 500,000 years , what made Homo erectus .
The second is , of course , the computer mouse .
It 's unusual that both of them have some of the size and shape .
I tried to see which is larger , but that 's nearly impossible .
And that 's because they 're both formed for human hand .
They 're technologies . " " After all , it 's a similarity isn 't even so interesting .
The having us that were both built , so that the wasted the human hands .
My interest is difference . Because object on the left you make with tiny change design more than one million years , in die : 1,500,000 — 500,000 years ago .
Homo erectus made the same tool over 300,000 generations .
Of course , there are some change , but tools in that time it transitions slower as the skeleton people .
I don 'texisted progress , nor innovation .
It 's an incredible phenomena , but it 's true .
Now , the object in the right is obsolete for five years .
And there 's also another difference , and that 's that the object on the left is made up of one material .
And on the right is made combination of different materials from silicone to the metal , plastics and so forth .
And what 's more to that is combination different ideas , an idea of plastic , laser , the idea of transistors .
Everything that 's in this technology with recombining .
And it 's this combination of , this on afterward technology 's what fascinated . I think that 's the secret to understanding of what 's going on in the world .
Even my body is to accumulating ideas , the idea of leathered cells , brain cells and liver cells .
Everything that 's connected .
As evolution does this accumulation , this abinors ?
We 're using the sexual reproduction .
If appear two different mutations in animals one withoutpo headed species , here tagged green and the red one of them 's got to be a better than the other .
One go extinct , to the other lived .
But if we go about kind of with gender , then can same individual to inherit both mutations of different lines the family .
I headed the individual than allows sos draw from the genetic upgrades around your species .
It 's just limited to their lineage .
And the way they is so effect in the cultural development , what has sex in the biological development ?
I think that the answer is exchange business , us exchange one thing for the other .
It 's a unique human apprta .
There 's no animal don 't .
And there 's learn in labs to the what-to exchange . Of course in animals there 's a mutuality . But exchange one subject for the other would not happen .
" She 'd left Adam Smith : " " Nobody has seen this before a dog , who would did fair exchange business bones with others . " " ( Laughter ) The cultures without changing the deal to have you can . "
You can have a no- headed culture .
Chimpanzes , theiller whales and these animals , they have culture .
They s learn traditions that pass on parents to their offspring .
In this case , learn chimpanzees each other 's apart , like they stones .
But the difference here is that these cultures never 's not growing , doesn 't , you don 't grows collecting and never recombining . " " And that 's so that we don 't sort of sexual of sex , no exchange of ideas .
So the groups chimpanzees have different cultures .
Now , these are not exchange ideas .
So why , why are so exchange business increase of living ?
The answer allowed in 1817 David Ricardo .
And this is his story in version of the Stone Age , even when he tell him in the connectivity with business between nations .
Adam make for four hours one arrow and in three hours one withkeru .
Oz make for one hour one arrow and in two hours one withkeru .
Oz is from Adam better in producing arrows withkier .
The Adam doesn 't need .
Can you make your own arrows and axe .
Well , not quite , because when understanding invent , if you make the Oz two arrows and Adam two axe and then do business , both of them saved an hour of work .
And the more that will hold onto , the more that 's true . " " Because it 's the more they do , the better go Adam , production withkier , and Ozov production arrows .
Theing sites of exchange of goods will be so continue to grow up .
And this is one of beauty exchange deal , is actually creating momentum for greater specialization , which then creating momentum for more exchanges and so on .
And I 've also saved both of Oz for one hour .
This is a prosperity , saving time satisfying needs .
Ask yourself , how much time you had to work , so you do care for one hour of light to read tonight .
If you had to start from scratch , let 's say that you go out to the rural areas .
There 'sc . We charge it . You get of it here .
Us you cook it . You your candle and so forth .
How long did I tell you this will it take ? Pretty long .
How long have to today in fact to work in order to earned for an hour of light to read , if you live in the U.K. and the average pay you have ?
The answer is that about a half a seconds .
In 1950 you had to work eight seconds average wages , so you do care so much light .
And that 's seven-and-a-half seconds well-being , who get . So , from 1950 . Because it 's seven-and-a-half seconds , if you can do something different . " " Or you could get another good or a service .
And in 1800 would it took 15 minutes to the average wages for earned for an hour of light .
" In 1800 you would be had to work six hours to earned the candle that would uped an hour .
In other words , an average making the average person you in 1800 couldn 't afford candle .
" Well we 've pästn picture , and a mouse and let me ask : " " Who , and for whose made them ? " " " lin make someone for themselves . "
It was myself independent .
Today , that 's called poverty .
But object in the right made by other people for me .
How many people ?
" Decades ? " " Hundreds ? " " Thousands of ?
I think it 's to millions .
Because we 've got to counting the guy that growing coffee that cook for a man that on drill , cut oil , which should make plastics and so on .
They all worked for me , I 've made to a mouse .
This is how it works society .
This we as a species had achieved .
In ancient ages , when he was person rich , people for him worked literally .
Just so you could be Gods , you had to employ them .
The People 's sling XIV . work a lot of people .
They produced for him the ridiculous the costumes , what 's this one . ( Laughter ) And they were doing to the ridiculous hairstyles .
He was 498 people who preparing for him dinner every day .
But even modern tourist , who walk Versadlean 's psor and looks at images People welcomed XIV . , has a 498 people who they prepare dinner for him .
It 's people in bi hills , cafes , restaurants , and shops around the Paris . They 're all are ready you within hours obs serve a great food , that 's probably more powerful , what the Peoplesd XIV . ever had . "
This is what we 've made , because we 're working for each other .
We 're able to use specialization and business , to increased each other 's living .
Of course , they 're animals that they work for each other .
The typical example are ants : workers working for queen , and the other way around .
But it 's a big difference that it 's going on only within a particular colonies .
There 's no mutual cooperation among colonies .
And that 's forbe start abu work .
I mean , they specialize given to breed .
That 's in charge of queen .
Our species 's very don 't like .
It 's one thing that we want to conduct all for themselves — reproduction .
( Laughter ) And we don 't even in the U.K. , we reproduction on the queen .
( Applause ) When the this custom originated ?
And how long already exists ? What actually mean ?
I think it 's the oldest version of is about gender aba work .
Now , I don 't have no evidence .
It looks , so that , as the first we started to work man for a woman and a woman for a man .
Today , in every community hunting and gatherings there 's aba work by trying food overall between man hunters and women foragers .
We don 't always it 's so simple . But they 're spread specialized role men and women .
" Beautiful on this system is that it 's benefited for both sides .
This woman knows , in this case tribe Hadza — he wouldn 't roots to them with men swap for meat — knows that if you want to get to the meat , you can dig a few roots to rest and swap them for meat .
And don 't have to help to try to the toys .
And the man again knows that don 't have a bunching , if you want to have roots .
Instead , if you make sure that the words withvi horse 's going to be a great , to share with you in it .
And so both side increase each other living through gender a work .
When it started ? That we don 't know , but it 's possible that 's don 't marksn 't do .
They want to a very large extent cooperate .
So , he was very smart .
Ku the end was their brain in the average bigger than is my or anyone of you in this room .
They were invent . They dead aftere .
They probably have a language , because today , we know that had the same gene called FOXP2 like us . Gne , who discovered here in Oxford .
And it seems that they had language skills .
They were genius people . I don 't want them to .
But we don 't have the evidence for gender a work .
We don 't have the evidence that the women covered harvest .
It seems that women collaborated with men to hunt .
And the other thing , for which there can be no evidence , is business exchange between groups . Because objects that you can find between don 't bra marks remains , made tools , are always of local materials .
For example , Ka show you find theland with the local tools Neanderthal .
I always are made from local corners .
The same valley are human remains from the same period , a 300,000 years . Some are of local corner sheep , but most , many are made from the sort of median , that comes from far away .
And when people started this transmit objects , demonstrates , their group traded .
He 's 10 times as old as agriculture .
People forget this . He regarded as modern invention .
The change retail between groups of people 's hundreds of thousands of years .
And the first evidence that appears in Africa before the 80 — 120,000 years ago , when they 're seeing , is that both sort of median and Ipis goes in Ethiopia for long distances .
And we 've seen — how you find this team scientists here in Oxford — how they travel from 200 Mediterranean through Algeria inland .
That proves that already people started with exchanged business between groups .
And that 's finally led to specialization .
How do we know that migrating into a long distances means trade , not migration ?
Stop , looking at the modern andborigns , of hunting and gatherings who benefiting stone for axe at a place called Mt . Is , belongs in property tribe Calcutdoon .
They axe exchange in their neighbors behind a day 's the bunches . And so get stone axe in a big parts of Australia .
Puting tools to long distances so it 's the sign of trade , not peak migration .
What happens if people froming exchange business , the ability to exchange and specializing ?
The answer is that , that you can technological development not only slow down , but you can also have to sleeptoy .
An example of Tassing .
When level seas followed and Tassing 10,000 years ago became Islands , where people don 'ting with only downgrade development , compared with people on land , but experienced actually regreia .
Inzed skills to make tools of bone , fishing tooling and clothes , because population , roughly 4,000 people , wasn 't a big enough to preserve the specialized skills necessary to sustain technologies that they had .
That 's like all of us sit down to abandoned island .
How many of the things that we have in the pockets , then we would keep able to make a 10,000 years ?
I don 't happen right on Ti Earth , on a similar island with a similar populations .
The reason is that Tis the ground is from South America separates much already know , . And through , is maintained business withsk in those 10,000 years .
Tasans have been isolated .
Let 's go back to this picture and ask for not only that , who and for whose object did , but also , who knew how to make ?
In the case of the stone axe , a man who 've made , it knew how to do it .
But who knows how to make computer mouse ?
No one . We literally no one .
No one on this planet doesn 't know how to make computer mouse .
And I think it 's serious . "
The principal companies to make computer mice don 't .
He knows just how to knows a company .
One in production lines don 't , because they have no idea how to do oil drilling that got to the oil , from where you make plastic and so on .
We all know only little bits , but nobody know whole .
" Of course , quote from the famous essays Leonardo Rea , an economist , 50 . years , known as " " I , our pencils , " " in which he writes about how pencils and like no one know how we actually make it , because those who put it , don 't benefit graphite . " " And don 't know it 's not benefit wood and things like that . "
As human society we deal with exchange and specialties created the ability to make things , it 's not that we don 't understand .
It 's other , like in the case of language .
In language , they have to pass on more thoughts and ideas , which we 're understanding .
But in technology can make things that transcend our skills .
Capact human mind we 've been to a remarkable measurements .
By the way , that 's what 's one of the reasons why I 'm interested debate about the I.Q. , about whether some groups people have higher IQ than others .
It 's quite trivial .
The company 's what it 's how people are sharing their thoughts and ideas and as working together . It 's , they are her individuals are .
So , we 've created what we call collective brain .
We 've only used in networks .
We 're neurons in this brain .
And it 's exchanged ideas , linking and crossing ideas between them , which leads to the development of technologically gradually , bit by bit .
However horrible things would happened .
And in the future , the that we apply ahead , of course , they 'rely horrible things .
They war , of economic crisis , natural disaster .
I 'm quite sure it 's going to happen in this century 's terrible things .
But I 'm sure that , through also the contacts that humans make , and thanks to the options connect and crossing ideas like never before , I 'm sure that technology will be to make progresss and with her lifeed level .
Because through the cloud computing , through crowded withuring and through the world from bottom-hore , what we 've created , we 're not already only elit , but every can have their ideas , connect and crossing them . Pretty certainly so accelerate rate of innovation .
Thank you .

My name is Andst .
So 18 months ago I worked in Google to something else , but under kicking this idea of how to create something about museums and art my boss , which is here , and she 's also me passed .
It took me 18 months .
And let me tell you , this project accompanied amount of a happy interviews and stories with 17-tis very interestings museums of nine-t countries .
So I want to righted at the presentation this program .
The many stories , it 's why we 've done that .
I think my personal story is very simply explained on the slide , and this is a start .
I grew up in India .
" I got a great education , I can 't complain about it , but I didn 't have access to many museums and an artistic pieces .
So when I began travel and in museums , a lot of I started to learn .
And while I 'm working in Google , I 'm trying to work on achieves this dream which most by technology .
So , we 've created team , a big team , and we started work on it .
I 'm going to get into the showingt program , and then tell you a couple of examples of the neat things that we get from our begins .
So simply you go on the page GoogleAProject.com.
You look what museums are available .
There are the museum Uffiz , MoMA , Erbbling , Rijks , museum Van Goghha .
So , I went on one of my all-time favorites , Metropolitent museum Arts in New York City .
They 're two ways you get inside , it 's very simple .
Now you and , boom , you 're in a museum .
It doesn 't on it , where there 's currently — the bombs , Mexico , really doesn 't matter .
They 're going inside , talk .
You are somebody who wants to take you in a museum navigated ?
Open plan and one clicks in Get out .
You 're there and you want to go to the endridor .
The continue , for it .
I study this .
( Applause ) Thank you . And I went to the best .
( Laughter ) So now I 'm one of my favorites had , from the Kosovo and the Bre-trad of the Metropolitan Museum .
" I see brand " "pus " " . "
If we museum offer image , clicks on it .
This is one of the images .
It 's based on the metadt 's information .
Those of you who 's really interested in art , can click down here — I click here right now .
This is one of the image that we detect something calledgigapixel technology .
So this image for example , accountable about 10 billion pixels .
" A lot of people ask me , " you get 10 billion pixels ? " "
So I 'm now to show you what we get with 10 billion pixels .
You can really simply to image .
Here you can see that there 's happening something fun . "
I like this guy , his expressions are amazing .
But you get really into the deep .
So I started move it around and I found something that 's going on here .
" I said , " " Wait , that 's interesting . " " I continued look , and I noticed that those kids to something banging . "
I 've done a little survey , I was talking to a few of my contacts of the Metropolitaned museum and I finally figured out that it 's a game called lest game , and is ins hit the kind of cane torong Tuesday .
Obviously it 's very popular .
I don 't know why it 's doing , but something I know about it .
If you want to get even deeper , you can see the marketbs .
And I just told you that could explain from a particular perspective ,ed it , so you can actually see , what do we reach .
Here we were , and this is a painting .
( Applause ) The coolest thing still comes — the second .
Now quickly jump into MoMA , again in New York City .
The next of my favorite , " " Start night . The example that I just showed you , they 's foundeding details .
But what if you want to see the brushsca ?
What if you want to see what Van Gogh actually created this masters pieces ?
Canjoy and really get to deep paintings .
We 're getting to one of my favorite parts of this painting , to small marketlinks .
This is a Starna night , as is probably no one has ever seen .
Let me show you another my favorite virtue .
There 's a lot , but I 'm a short time .
This is really amazing part . It 's called Thebirs .
Anyone of you , it 's one , whether you 're rich or poor or you have forpsy house — doesn 't matter .
You can go and create my own museum online , create own collection of all these images .
It 's very simple , get , and it 's . " " I created this collection of called Sed atring — just you can still approaching .
This is In ambassadors , placed in National a gallery .
You can describe stuff , to send friends , to start conversation about what if you feel , if you 're going through these masters friendships pieces .
To conclude , I want to say that for me , it 's probably the most important is that all of these fantastic work doesn 't leave actually from Google .
It didn 't come , I think , even from museums .
I mean , I didn 't have to talk about .
In fact , they come from those artists .
From comes my modest experience .
I want to say that trust live this digitalm medium , whose artistic work fullys and properly have it online .
" The bottomest question that currently I ask is , " " We 'd think that 's because to replace the experience walking into the museum ? " " The answer is , " " " " " . "
But to her to do it .
And that 's what 's it . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
My name is Jane McGonigal . I 'm a designer computer games .
In the world of games that really we are reaching more but also .
A World of Warcrafting together they 've spent 593 million years solution virtual problems countries Andzeroth .
That may not be necessarily something bad .
We emerge out in heart and associate easier 's kind of .
And in the final result you build stronger social relationships .
Each month it be five million people .
That 's the problem , what I 'm trying to solve .
It 's artwork , I study , why are great .
Anyway , it 's it 's not the opa situation .
The real world has to more start to play .
I 'm also discovered amazing the acted drives , we had the slides .
People have suffered . Fed between each other .
It 's a really exciting time .
Herootos writes that the 18 years and so the king , that I decided to play one last game in cubes .
We 're trying to imagine a perfect triumphs , and then we want to give people the resources to do them .
That 's a game we 've created in 2007 .
Will you an amazing story and adventure .
We have to play comic book , have a system level in skills than knowledge , bringing knowledge , sustainability , predictness and ingenuity .
" My idea of " " sick " " is a very simple idea that can release billion great ideas , which , in us in a time lum . "
And this simple thing that it can do that , it 's sleep .
— laughter — ( Applause ) — This is a room full of successful women . This is a room
" It 's full of doesn 't women .
I 'm in the met a prize sleep .
A two and a half years ago I fainted from the exhaustion and wouldn 't .
And the fall , I head came about table and broke a cheeks towardness , what I 've had five stitches on the far right eye .
And so I started a journey of discovery importance of sleep .
During this period I 've studied , interacted with specializations with the doctors and scientists . And now I 'm here to tell you explained that the only way to productivem life full ofm satisfaction and inspires leads through enough sleep .
We — ( Applause ) — women , we 're going to play a major role in this revolution . It 's like a benefit of women .
They literally speaking — to get to the top , and it 's literally !
— laughter — ( Applause ) — because unfortunately for men is the deficit sleep something like a symbol of manhood .
Recently I lunched with one guy who turned by last night sleeping only four hours .
" I didn 't taste say — but I told him 's — I wanted to tell him , " " You know what ?
" If you within five hours , this lunch could fall into much more interesting — laughter — " " There 's one kind of lack of sleep always to beed and successful people . "
" Thely here in Washington D.C. , if you want to meet with somebody in the morning and you ask , " " What so around the eighth ? " " , probably you answers : " " the eighth 's too late . But that 's okay . We 'll play tennis , running a few talks and then you encounter about eighth . " " And yet you think they 're an amazinglyload , busy and productive , but the truth is that anything so are not . Because we had about a great leaders — the managers in business , in finance , in politics — who is doing terrible decisions . "
So high I.Q.
doesn 't mean that you 're good leaders . The bottom line leadership because it 's ability to see the iceberg before it 's going to hit the Titanic .
And to our Titans already , it ran huge amount of glaciers .
I really have the feeling that if society Lehman Brothers ( Lehman brothers ) was Lehman Brothers and Sisters ( Lehman brothers and sisters ) , still would work . (LB as financial institutionsed 15 .09 .2008 )
"- ( Applause ) — " " Whereas allbra " " they were high-load divine every day of the week , maybe you some " " lost time " " not upcoming an iceberg , because the sure woke up after seven-and-a-half-hour or eight-hour of sleep and she 'd be able to see things a larger context . "
And so while we face crises all the current world , what 's good for us in personal plane , which we bring more of happiness , gratitude and efficiency into our lives and what 's good for our career , at the same time , it 's best for the whole world .
I 'm asking you , asite eyes and discover invest huge ideas that reside in you . Turn off your their engine and discover the power of sleep . "
Thank you .
( Applause ) — —
Well , as Chris highlight I study , the human brain — functions and structure of the human brain .
It 's think for a moment about what it includes .
Here 's this fiddpenin- matter — the three pounds a violinpens that you in the outskirts of the hands , and can degrad contemplate these infiniteity betweenhyden space .
Can you contemplate these life forever , and can degradey thinking about the fact that it 's about sense the infinite .
And this my picturen recuriven the kind of observation that we 're called self-awareness , which I think is Sucwhile Gal of neurod , neuroscience , perhaps , one day we understand .
Okay , so how you study this mysterious organ ?
I mean , you 've got 100 billion nerve cells , small from places protoplasma , which together interact and from this activity is show entire spectrum of capabilities that we call human nature of and human consciousness .
So how does it do so ?
Well , it 's a lot of ways ofed to functions of the human brain .
One way , that it 's largely use is to study patients with permanent damaged by a small region of their brain , where happened the genetic change in a small regions of the brain .
What 's then to happen , it 's not a wholeed reduce all of your mental capacity , something on the way dumbing your ability to think .
What you 're going , it 's very selecive loss one functions while the other functions remain don 't disrupted , and this gives you some confidence in the argument that this part of the brain is somehow reported in the mediating the functions .
So can interface with structure function and then find out what these circuits they 're doing , to create that particular function .
So this is what trying to do .
Let me show you some of the surpriseives examples .
In fact , in this talk I 'll give you three examples , every after six minutes .
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome . "
If you look at the first picture , this is temporal lobes , faces , lobesable lobes — lobes that produce brain .
And if you look at the map in internal the surface temporal lobes — there it there 's — it 's a little structure called the fusiform gyrus of .
And that 's called a face area brain because if you damages , you can 't recognize human faces .
I still can people to recognize the voice and say , well okay , that 's Joe , but you can 't look at their face and tell you who it is .
And you don 't recognize ourselves in the mirror .
I mean , you know that it 's you , because if you 're going to str , shrinks to even he and , you know , it 's a mirror , but they actually didn 't recognize it myself as myself .
Okay . This syndrome is well known consequence damageed the fusiform gyrus .
But there 's another rare syndrome , really so rare that heard about him , very few doctors , even between neuroscientists .
" This is called Capgras of , and it 's this about the patient , who 's otherwise completely normal and who suffer the trauma head , takes the coma , otherwise it 's completely okay , looks at her mother and says , " " And this woman , looks exactly like my mother , but it 's frauds — " "
" Is that another woman who pretend that it 's my mother . " " And now , why it 's going on ? "
Why would someone — and this man is completely a number ofed and understanded in all the other directions , but seeing her mother of his act , and on speak him that it 's mother .
Moster interpretation of this that you 'd find in all psychiatristtric textbooks is Fre of the widowhood perspective , and that 's that this guy — by the way , the same arguments pay for women , but I 'm only going to talk about men —
if you 're still a child , baby , if you feel strong sexual attraction to your mother .
This is the so-called Fressi Oopsian complex .
I 'm not saying believe , but it 's a regular Fre of the widowhood view .
And then , like you grow , the brain cortex is ongoing , and suppress these hidden sexual desires in your mother .
Thank God , because otherwise you were all sexually excited at your mother .
And then will be here , to look into your head what damage it cortex , and you 're going to allow this hidden sexual desire on , and on the surface , and simultaneously , unaccountably you find that excites you own mother .
" And you say , " " My God , if that 's a my mom , how is it possible that I sexually excited ? "
" It 's another woman . It 's frauds . " " That 's the only explanation , which makes yourm lesioned brain sense . "
It 's never been this argument powers don 't make sense .
It 's very profound , as just all Fre , let 's the arguments- ( Laughter ) — but doesn 't told a big meaning , because I 've seen the same kind of , patient with the same self-d of his obvi . ( Laughter )
" And say , " " Dr , this isn 't FFi , looks exactly like F-fi , but it 's some other dog . " " Yeah ? "
So , here 's use Fressian explanation .
( Laughter ) You start hidden talk about the best of you inside all the people or something similar , which is of course a completely meaningless . "
So what 's really going on ?
Well to explain this interesting disorder , we look at the structure and functions the normal vision pathways in the brain .
Well , normally visual signals enter inside the our eyes , and travel into the visions brain areas .
In the rear of brain is in fact about 30 areas addressing just vision , and integrating it all , toward news to a little structure called the fusiform gyrus of where we faces .
It 's out there neurons sensitive to faces .
" You can call it a face area brain .
I talked about before .
When it 's this area damaged , you lose the ability to see the faces , right ?
But from this area behave gradually leads into the structure called the amygdala in limic system , the emotionaled core brain , and this structure , called amygdala , emotional measuring the importance of what you 're .
It 's prey ? It 's a predator ? It 's partner ?
Or it 's something completely trivial , like pieces ol , or a little bit of chalk or — I don 't want to show the but — or shoes or something like that , of ? Okay ?
Something that you can completely ignored .
So , if there is amygdala activated and this is important , claning ground for the autonomic nervous system .
Your heart starts beating faster ,
started sweating , to get rid of the heat that you create the muscle 's risk .
And that 's convenient , because to your hand , we can actually put two electrodes and measure change the skinn disgust response to called sweating .
So when we 're looking at something , I can to assess , whether you 're excited by or whether you 're excited to or not , yeah ?
And I 'll get about a moment .
So my idea was that when this guy look at the object — or anything , it goes into the visions areas and — and anyway , it 's processed in the fusiformna fromav , and you ' recognize as plays or table , say , or your mother , yeah ?
And then the news gradually that goes into amygdals and then down the autonomic neural system .
Well maybe in this guy , it 's the connection between amyged and the limbic system — emot nuclear accident brain — interrupted .
" So because in the fusiform gyrus is intact , guys can still recognize her mother , and say , " " , looks like my mother . " " Well , it 's because it 's connection to the emotional centers of interrupted , she says , " " How 's possible , if it 's my mother , " " I don 't feel any aness ? " " Or horror , which we can also be ? That ? "
" ( Laughter ) And that 's why he says , " " I 'll explain this unaccountable thenness emotions ? "
This cannot be my mother . "
" It 's a foreign woman , which gives off for my mother . " " How do you test ? "
Well , if we take anyone of you here and stand up in front of a canvas and we measure thingsvanic answer your skin and to project images on a canvas , I know from measure how sweating , when you can see object , like table or an umbrella — of course you don 't hold it .
If you 'll show you a picture of lions or tigers or naked girls , there 's something you start to get sweating , right ?
" And , believe it or not , if you 'll show you a picture of your mother — and I 'm talking here about the normal people- you start to sweating .
And you don 't have to be even Jews .
( Laughter ) So what happens , if it 's show this patients ?
You take patients and for him images to a canvas and of focusing his skined thingsvanic response .
Stly and chairs and ols , nothing happened , as the normal people , when you picture you show him his mother , things likevanic leathered the answer is flat .
What is missing is emotional response to his mother 's the connection because that 's field of vision into emoal centers is interrupted .
So his vision is normal , because the visual areas are normal , his emotions are normal — will laughing , will be cry , and so forth — but from connection to emotions is interrupted and suffer from because of that his mother 's frauds .
It 's lovely example kind of things that we do , take bizzarded , seemingly incomprehensible , neuro-psyric syndrome and for your hands that the classic Fre of the widowhood is wrong that , in fact , it know precisely be explained in terms of known neuroanatoms of the brain .
"ms go , if this patient , his mother from neighboring room calls — phone — and he raises the head and says , " " Wow , mom , as you 've got ? " " Where are you ? " " The phone no kind of doesn 't exist . "
" And then the village to him it comes up to me , and he says , " " Who are you ? "
" " looks exactly like my mother . " " Yeah ? "
The reason for that is that there 's a head of a department of hearings centers in the brain in the centers the emotionalal , and that accident was not interrupted .
So this explains why her mother phones without problems recognize .
When it 's personally , says that it 's frauds .
I mean , like this complex system circuits in the brain constructed ?
It 's nature , genes or it 's the parenting ?
And this problem we go so that we appreciate another interesting syndrome called phantom limbs .
And you all know what it 's phantom limbs .
When amputing your hand or your foot , because of gangrene or lose them in war , for example , in the Iraq War- now it 's a real serious issue — to continue to a very , very vividly after the feel the present lacking hands and we call this phantoms arm or leg .
In fact , can you of this phantom , almost at every single part of the body .
Believe it or not , even at an internal bones .
I was patient with eliminated meteric — after a hysterectomy — that had phantom myteric , including phantom emissions office change systems of pain in the right age moon .
He was me one student asked if they get a phantom of a changeturation syndrome ?
( Laughter ) The subject worthy scientific explorations , and we 're after that don 't go there .
So the next question is , what 's about phantom limbs can find out of trials .
One of the things that we 've discovered , was that about half patients with your phantom limbs say that can with his phantome to move .
The taps brother on the shoulder , raises phones when theing , the parting a frog .
They 're very impressive , living feelings .
Patient don 't suffers of .
Does that hand there but even though it 's for a compelling a sensual experience .
However , in about half the patients to do not .
" Theantom limbs — they say , " " But Mr. doctor , the phantom limbs is no . "
It 's like the animal , , fromsred in a flock and unbearably hurts .
If I with her only toh , maybe I relieved from pain . Why would be phantom limbs in ?
Sounds like againstreate .
But when we 're looking at to affectiss , we found that in these people with a quadriplegics phantom limbs , your hand was original paralyzed by because of bareland peripheral ne initial ,
don 't real stocking hand , was interrupted , was disconnected , say , the motorcyclelo accident .
So for patient had a real hand , which wasla , for a couple of months ' or six year ofhyms in a popru and then we experimented to this pain in your hand to get him surgeon arm amputs and has a phantom hand with the same-s pains .
And this is serious clinical problem .
The patients can be governed by the depression .
Some of them it into the outbreak suicide .
So how to treat this syndrome ?
Why rises in phantom limbs ?
When I looked into the affectists , I 've found that patients should real hand and nerves that it supplied , were reved and real hand abouting all and laying of suspended to struhu several months before the amputation and this pain has went even into the phantom .
Why that happens ?
" When was hand 's pristine , but in frontal brain into hands send commands , saying " " ck " " buted putting a visual feedback " " No . " " Pohani . No . Pohani . No . Pohani . " " No . "
And this is inpe beginning in the circuits in the brain , and we 've called 's trained in meeting , okay ?
The brain learn , as a result of this Hebs andssociative connection that simple movement command in the hand is creating feeling overwhelmed hands
and then when arm amput , this trained in movement bring into your notion of body and in your phantom .
But how do these patients help ?
How do you get fromn to sharpened in of it to make iting from a ni column , animaling stands out the phantom 's hands ?
Well , let 's what if you sent phantom commands , but they gave him a series visual feedback that my command the head ?
Perhaps you 've done away from the phantom 's pain phantom 's a cramps .
How do you do it ? " " Well , virtual reality .
But it cost millions of dollars .
So I found a way to do in three dollars , but he doesn 'sravise 's my sponsor .
( Laughter ) Okay ? What you do is that you create 's what I call the mirror a box .
You have a cardboard box with mirror in the middle , and then you put phantom — so , my first patient , Derek , came .
Ru of him amputed 10 years ago .
He was taken from shoulders , so nerves were taken and hand quadriplegic , laid year of suspended to stru and then was and amputated .
He had a phantom hand , unbearably a painful with it and couldn 't move .
It 's no phantoms hand .
So they came up and I gave him this mirror , in a box which I call the mirror a box .
Patient puts his left side phantom hand that 's a series ofsre in a flocks on the left side of the mirror , healthy hand on the right side of mirror and give it into the same semi-hy , ofscret , looks in the mirror and what get ?
And looking at that , as is his phantom revived because looks at his hand healthy reflection in the mirror , and it looks like , how would was this phantom refreshed .
" " Now , " " I said " " do look , cring his phantomes true — your fingers or move real fingers , until you will you look in the mirror . " " It 's going to have a visual impression , phantom moves . "
" That 's obvious , but surprising thing is that patient at that says , " " Oh my God , my phantom again moving and pain , animaling the allowed . " " And remember , my first patient who he walked — ( Applause ) — thank you . ( Applause ) My first patient he walked in , look in the mirror , and I said to him , " " Look at suddenly your phantom . " " And he started gigting and says , " " I see your phantom . " " But isn 't stupid . Does that it 's not real . "
It knows that it 's the mirror suddenly , but it 's living a sensual experience .
" And now , I said , " " move my hand healthy and phantome . " " He said , " " Oh , I can 't move my phantma . " " You know it yet . It 's painful . " " I 'm like , " " move my hand healthy . " " And he said , " " Oh my God , my phantom again , moving , I can 't believe it ! "
" And my pain is gone . " "
" And then I said , " " . " " Intri eyes closed your eyes . "
" " move your hand of healthy . " "
" " Oh , it 's , again , is in-s views . " "
" " Okay , open your eyes . " "
" " Oh my God , oh my God , again moves ! "
Well , and he looked like a child , in the sugar .
So I thought , okay , well this demonstrates my theory of tiled in and crucial role of the visual input , but I won 't Nobel Prize for that someone help move his phantomal limb .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) when you think about it , it 's completely useless ability . " " ( Laughter )
But then I started to realize that maybe to other species in the which you can in neurology to meet , like stroke , the causes dysstonia — can be a certain trained ingredient that you can overcome simple inventions for a mirror .
" So I said , " " Look , " " Derek- well , in particular , the guy with you can 't all wear mirror to alleviate their pain — I said , " " Look Derek , take it home and traininguj with him week or two . "
" Maybe after a while exercise of " " goes without a mirror , fromnas the meetings , start move his in- hand , and then she 's , " " pain . " " So he said fine and take it home . "
" I said , " " Look , finally , it 's two dollars . Take it home . " " So I took it home and after two weeks , called me and said , " " Dr , this won 't to believe . " " I said , " " What for ? " " And , " " he 's gone . " " So I ask , " " What is gone ? " " I thought that maybe disappeared mirrors box . "
" ( Laughter ) He said , " " No , no , no , you know the phantom , I had the last 10 years ? "
" " disappear . " " And I said — I started concerned , say , thought , my God , I mean , I turn his picture of a body where remained human page , aka , and all this ? "
" And I said , " "erc , disturbing ? " " And he 's you , " " No , I didn 't have other three days phantom hand- and so no phantomous pain elbow , no animaling , no phantom-flak in front of pain , all the pain are gone . "
" But the problem is that I 'm still phantomous fingerss from my shoulder and your box there we will never . " " ( Laughter ) " " So , could you change the design and give me it on the forehead , so I , you know , to reached and could take out your phantomous fingers ? " " He thought , " " I 'm a magician . "
So , what 's happening ?
It 's the case , because the brain is faced with a huge sense contradictions .
From vision gets news , phantom 's back .
On the other hand , there 's no competent perception , muscles signals tells you that hand 's not there , OK ?
And your movement commands say that hand here 's and for this conflict you brains say , the hell with , there 's not any phantom , there is no hand .
It gets to some forms of rejecting — we 're in denial signals .
And when it 's gone hand , bonus is that it 's gone also pain , because you can 't have from physical a floating paining in space .
So that 's a bonus .
But , and this technique was from trying on dozens patients in other groups in Helsins so you can show how valuable the treatment phantom 's pain and really , people it tried to rehabilitation of stroke are being .
The deads normally you 're thinking as a lesions in the strands , nothing what could do something .
Well it turns out that a certain ingredientsing of stroke are being is also trained in meeting , and maybe this ingredient gave to overcome using mirrors .
This also were clinical exams , and actually helped a lot of and many patients .
Okay , let me now go on the third part of my talk , which is about next interesting phenomenon callednesthesia .
It was discovered the Francis Galton 's in the 19th century .
It 's cousin of Charles Darwin .
I showed that some people in population , who are other ways , completely normal , had to follow fromspeciallyness — whenever they saw number , was colorful .
Five is blue , with a seven yellow , green a wasps ' , the ninth , " " Yellow " " indgo .
Remember that these people are in all other ways normal .
Or high C . Sometimes note to call the sense colors .
high C is blue , high F green , another note can be yellow , yeah ?
Why is happening ?
This is called a synesia — Galton 's called sonsthes , foring a senses .
For us are all of the senses to discriminated .
These people up their senses .
And why this is happening ?
One of two different aspects of this problem 's very bizarre .
Synesthesia it occurs in people 's families , so Galton to concluded that has dediation base , genetic basis .
And second , synesia is about — and here that brings me to my point about the main the theme of this session , which is creativity — synesia is eight times more between artists , poets , authors and other creatives people than it is in the normal population .
Why is that ?
The water tell this question .
No one 's it 's not .
Okay , what 's son growing ? What caused it ?
Well , it 's a lot of theories .
" One says that are just crazy .
Well , it 's not very scientific theory , so at her we can forget .
Then it 's report that they are lyings and persevered .
Well , it can be partly true , because it 's more erred here , in Bay Andre than in San Diego .
( Laughter ) Okay . So , a third theory — well , let 's say , about what really tonesia idea ? Okay ?
So we found that area color and area numbers are in the brain , in the fusiformna fromav , right next to myself .
So we said , there 's in the brain that random evening between color and numbers .
And so whenever you see number , you see answer a color and so you suffer sonsthesy .
Remember — you know , why it 's going on ?
Why wouldn 't in some of these people should be circuits crossed ?
Do you remember , as I say , it 's occurs in people 's families ?
This brings you to track .
And that 's that there is areal gene , himation in gene , which causes this crossing circuits .
As it turns out , each one of us , it has at birth connected everything with everybody .
So each part of the brain is involved with every other realm , and these connections are cleaned , to create characteristic moduleryn architecture adult brain .
So , if there is a gene causesing this for abandoning , and if you 're going to hised him you 're going to bother inadequate department neighboring brain areas
and if it 's case numbers and color , you get numbersh- color-nesthesia .
If it 's synes and colors , you get a sound-ne color-sy .
So far it 's understandable .
And now , what if it 's this gene ex depressed everywhere in the brain , so that everything is connected ?
" Well , think what have artists , writers and poets in common , it 's ability to engage metaphorical thinking connecting the seemingly unsy ideas , like , " " the East is and Juliet is the sun . " " Well , you don 't normally Juliet is the sun- means that it 's thatras round of fire ? "
I want to say , with schizophrenireard 's doing it , but it 's another story .
Well , normally people say is ana than the sun , like sun , makes life as the sun .
And they immediately did you find these connection .
If you 'll assume that this vaster connection and terms there are other parts of the brain , then it leads to more tend to metaphoricalm thinking and creativity in people with sonsthesy .
And for this reason is eight times higher synesthesia between poets , artists and writers .
Okay , it 's very h logical view ofnesthesia .
The last demonstration of — even minute ...
( Applause ) All right . Let me show you that you all are synesth , but you 're in denial .
Here I have what I calls that Martian alphabet , like your and , " " And it 's A , B is B , C is C ,
different shapes for different phonemes , yeah ?
Here you have that Martianex alphabet .
One of them is Kki , the other one is Buba .
Which is Kki and which Burba ?
How many of you think that 's Kiki and that 's Burba ? " " Raise your hands .
Well , that 's what we 've got one or two mutants .
( Laughter ) How many of you think that 's Buba , that 's Kiki ? " " Raise your hands ,
99 percent of you .
And now , no one of you is not that Martian , how did you do that ?
It 's because they all make crossed model — sonstic and abstract to learn — which means that says , that 's sharp curves , Kiki , in your auditory cortex , irritating in badk cells , Kiki , mimics the visual curves — the block the-ness of abated shape .
This is very important , because it tells you that your brain does something that looks like a stupid ly , but photons in your eye creating this shape and inaffeed the cells in your ear to inspire sound pattern , the brain is able to choose their common denominator .
It 's a primitive form and abstractions , and now we know that that happens in the fusiformna fromaving brain , because when it 's damaged , these people lose the ability to create Buba Kiki , but also lose the ability to think in metaphors .
" If you this guy ask : " " No , that 's all gold , what 's dots " " what does that mean ? " " He says , " " Well , that 's that it 's metal and glossy doesn 't mean that it 's gold . "
You 've got to measure the- density , not ? So them completely escape metaphoric importance .
So this area is about eightx bigger in higher primates , particularly in people , as the lower primates .
In this jana fromavings of something really interesting , because it 's the crossroad between hearing , vision and the and in people 's a huge — and there 's something very interesting .
And I think that 's the basis for a lot of entirely human ability as and abstractuction , metaphors and creativity .
All these questions that philosophers studied after millennia we can we scientists start to explore imaging brain , exploring patients and asking the right questions .
Thank you .
( Applause ) Sorry .
( Laughter )
This story is about imagination as taking seriously .
So 14 years ago , I first came across this ordinary material , fishingland network that you use the same way for several century .
Today , we 've used it to create stoods , meaninged forming , about the size of a normal buildings in cities around the world .
It certainly wasn 't person that would something done .
I 've never studied withsculture , engineering , or architecture .
In fact , after high school belonged to seven schools and artist refused me on each of them .
I decided that I would artist on a for 10 years , and I drew , and I got a Fulbright scholarships to India .
It 's a promise exhibitions my had , I sent a their painting and came into Mahaboipur .
It says term show came — but my paintings don 't .
I had to do something .
This fishing village was known sculptureculture .
So I tried from pouring bronze .
But big different fromats were too difficult and expensive .
I went I went for a walk on the beach , I watched fishermen networking in a networks of on the sand .
We just observed them every day , but this time I saw differently — new approach to sarosity , way to make volume formed without difficult and durable materials .
My first satisfying withcueptunru I created with these fishermen .
" It 's self-portraits called " " largeed sides . " " ( Laughter ) They even have trained them into pillar to get to photograph . "
I learned that it 's a surface reveal everyone ines wind in constantly shifting patterns .
And I wasnottised .
She 'd on artisanaled the tradition and collaborated artists , and then in Lit manufacturers a chips .
And I loved me the subtle detail that 's it into my work , but it 's mostly I wanted to — push them from object that you 're looking at something that you could lose it .
So I came back to India that I can work together with these fishings , we developed a network of a million and a half by hand of bounds nodes — recently , install decentralized in the Madrid , .
Thousands of people saw it , one of them was urbanist Manal Sola-Morles that sets for a designed the riverbanks in Por , in Portugal .
He asked me if I could this build as consistent pieces for the city .
I didn 't , if I managed to , I saved your art .
Ited , constructed , costs — these are opposs more pre-name , destly and the fleeting .
It took me two years than I found a thread that would survived ultraviolet beams , withed air , pollution , and at the same time , acted up your faceness , to freeing in the wind .
We needed something that would maintained network up there , in the middle of the traffic warden node .
So we 're off this 45,000 pounds (20 412 pounds ) hard ring , a steel ring .
We had to build , so that they la bottom moving in common in banks and survived Hurricanes .
We didn 't be nouction software tomodeled something porn and moving .
I discovered an amazing flying icon of Gar engine machine , which designs for flow ship ma ship of American jar , called Peter Hep suffering .
He help me to deal with this double challenge — precisey shape , and it 's a movement .
I couldn 't build it in a way that I knew , because by hand ined the nodes would keep don 't a hurricane .
So I got together with industrial plant of mine to make fishing nets as they 've learned , as machines work , and found a way to create landscape with them .
We didn 't no language , which we have translated this old , don 't understandable arts in something that can make me .
So we 've created .
Three years later , we 're two kids and they learn this 50,000 square feet (4645 feet square ) chipsed network .
It was incredible — what I be now cost , permanent and at the same time , nothing forsune 's .
( Applause ) This intersection of was about nothing and anonymous .
Now has his breath .
I walked under that for the first time .
We just observed how wind the type of choreography gradually open , protected I felt , and it 's also attached to infinite heaven .
My life will never be the same .
I want to make with these mas oass in the halls of the cities all around the world .
And I 'm going to share two directions that are in my work new .
Thestoric city office Philadelphia : I really felt that his square needs material for withcuept , which would be lighter than a network .
So we 're experimenting with tiny sprayed pieces water , to create a dry mlus that would be shaped by the wind . Testing we discovered that it could be shaped by people , can each appeal , move through it without 's .
They 's this with a material as the showing the rail trains feet on the surface in real time — as an X-ray decomposeing of the urban circulearing system .
The next challenge , Biennial America in Denver he asked me if I could displays 35 national Western hesph and their interconnectedness apted .
( Laughter ) I don 't I , where I 'm start , but I said yes .
I read about recently earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that just swed around the Pacific Oceans .
We 've drifted the grounds these tectonic the board ,ed the ground try rotation and literally with reduced the length of the day .
Thecontacted NOAA 's (N seeded Ocean and And 'feric It ) , and asked them if would provide me data about tsunami , and it into something that looks like that .
" The name of : " "261 . " " means the number of microseconds , about how much was the Earth 's day a shorter . "
This didn 't create the way that I knew — steel 's circle .
This shape was now too complex .
So I 've changed the gears for fine , smooth skin fiber , which was 15 times stronger than steel .
Thecueptunra now could be completely , because it was so light , could harness the existing buildings — literally to become part of the structure of the city .
We didn 't no software that would pushed for these complex networks forms and modeled them with gravity .
So we had to create .
Then I called about somebody from New York City and ask if I could adapt these concepts on the Times Square or the Highline (par in New-Y City ) .
This new structured method allows me to model and build these withcueptunry in the range of skyscrapers .
We 're not being touched , but now dreaming about their went in cities around the world , where there 's their most to . "
So 14 years ago , I 'm searching through beauty in the traditional things , in artisanaled forms .
Today , their combineing with a-tech materials and machineculture I 'm going to created sensed , molding , the size of buildings .
My art the horizons are constantly pushing .
Today , walk with this story .
I called my friend from Ping .
It represents in offices that never cared art , never onceed local art museum , of everybody who survives could , tried to get from building out and make them light to be withcueptunru .
They were in suits , lying on the grass , and take a look at what were the shifting rendering wind , next to people that we don 't know , and shared reinventing the world of wonder .
Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause ) Thank you , thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ( Applause )
