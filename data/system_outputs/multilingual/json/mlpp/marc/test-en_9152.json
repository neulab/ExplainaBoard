Comcast came out , ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level . Same problem . The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem . Additionally , I lost the 5G service on three occasions . I had to do a factory reset to restore this . I cannot recommend this modem / router based upon my experiences . I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem / router . It \u2019 s fantastic . I \u2019 v Had it for over a week with no problems . It \u2019 s faster and the range is greater than the Arris .

No effort to ship over night or provide a more expeditious delivery what so ever . how can anyone even consider buying here for black Friday or Christmas . Amazon wants to act like they are still the only option for online shopping . I could just have easily order this on homedepot or lowes or Walmart online . I could have received this same day had I gone to the store . And it is much easier to return something is there is issues with the alternatives . So why doesn ' t Amazon provide better service ?

I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone . I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100 % the phone having all the problems I didn ' t want to admit . I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone .

I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem . It is no longer constant , but frequently pops up when I power it on . You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away . But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume . If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart , if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio . I gave it two stars because it technically works , but a simple 2 into 1 audio connection would do the same thing and save you $ 30 .

And patience . I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other , unless you desire a divorce . Upon receiving this item , promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store . You will need to purchase : 2 3 \" # 6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short . You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts . Don ' t be too concerned , your # 6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny . The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea . The additional installation tip , is that once we had the mounting bracket in place , we tied a piece of chef ' s twine to each screw , with plenty of length . We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture . We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws , and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string . SUCH a pain and hassle , but for $ 90 , it looks good and works fine . Also , this one comes with a glass diffuser instead of plastic which I assume will hold up better over time and maybe look better too . I wouldn ' t say \" don ' t buy this \" , but I would be forewarned . I hope this review is helpful ! Good luck !",

However , for German engineering , the build quality isn ' t great .

Sometimes I was using them in louder environments ( at a race track , on a plane ) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily . I was not listening to music most of the time , typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time . Along those same lines , the noise isolation is nonexistent . So that really doesn ' t help matters when the volume does not go that loud . The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working . They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect . I ' ve contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes . So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip . GIven the relatively low amount of use these saw I am very disappointed that they failed so early . But the accessories they come with are excellent , I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them . The pouch could use a little mesh pocket inside to keep the charging cable contained , but that is another minor gripe about the whole setup in general .",

Pro : The robot is a new category of toy , or you can even call it a pet . It go explore by itself and it does not require a phone to do so . It wakes up in the morning and wanders around and makes cute noise . It greets you when you get home ( you have to make sure that he hears you and sees your face though ) . In summary , being autonomous is a major pro that you can ' t see from other products . Cons : 1 : too slow in processing your command . I think the chip is from 2015 . So can ' t expect too much in terms of processing speed . Also you can ' t expect it to be that smart because of this . 2 . Edge detection is just NOT GOOD ENOUGH . Sometimes it just runs at full speed and falls directly off the edge . The worst part is that sometimes when it ' s right on the edge , it misunderstands to be on air . This causes it to act irritated and shake its arms and fall off . I don ' t think this is merely a problem of software . 3 . It gets boring . Soon you ' ll realize its movements and responses are just algorithms and predictable . You get bored of it after no longer than a week . A toy is just a toy at the end . You don ' t want to spend $ 250 and eventually forget about it . In summery . It is a new and interesting experience to have a robot like this . But it is still very limited and you get bored of it very quickly . If you have extra money and really want the new experience , just get it . If you ' re debating whether to get it or not , don ' t trust the positive reviews here and forget about it - - it does not worth $ 250 ( or even $ 150 ) yet .",

You can see from the fact that the cloth was not properly folded and the case dirty . I also had to pay the costs for the customs myself , about 60 $ . So the sunglasses cost me 100 $ more . Pro : good glasses , looks good , fits well . I can ' t say anything about that . Contra : I find it a cheek that I got used sunglasses , especially after the first pair of glasses was bent and clearly had a mistake and my ass was sweetened by William Painter . And then there are the extra costs . Conclusion : Who does not come from the states and on gambling stands then she orders you . No recommendation",

I \u2019 m cutting out the weird white liner to see if that helps anything , and maybe the skirt wont slide up when it \u2019 s wet , or I may tack it to the side seam on the shirts .

There are a few options you can make when it comes to your hydroponic system , but many times the roots of your plants will be suspended in , misted with , or flooded with a nutrient solution ( you can design the nutrient system to meet the needs of your chosen plants ) , so that the plants still get everything they need .

From this listing it costs about store price ( still too much ) , but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason . It ' s a fun toy , but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better . I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more . I figured even if the slime was a failure , at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains . I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn ' t turn out right . The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part . I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing , the kid will still have fun with it . The slime quality with these is very hit or miss . Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not . Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates . This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys . I ' m sure this young kid will have fun with it , but all factors included it isn ' t worth returning and also not worth rebuying .",

I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch . It ' s also a standard design that I ' ve been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone . For the uninitiated , the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1 ) a personal microphone 2 ) a music streamer / speaker and 3 ) a voice recorder . Altogether , you have a 3 - in - 1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out . There ' s no music in the mic itself though . It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic . Or you can even sync your Spotify app . Note that the mic doesn ' t work with every app unfortunately . The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice ( separately too ! ) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you ' re in a karaoke room . Some things I would like to see future improvements on are : 1 ) there ' s some annoying feedback that doesn ' t seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic . If you ' ve figured this out , I ' d love to know ! 2 ) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky . I ' m a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker . 3 ) support for more karaoke apps Finally , because the sound comes out of this mic directly , and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system , it ' s not as fun in a party setting . If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem , that would make this infinity more enjoyable .",

I could not feel the wind , so I feel that is a good sign . However , I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain / snow ( supposed to be resistent ) .

Straight out the pack just running my hand through there was shedding . After I was washed it even more shedding . There was rust in the hair . Yes , that \u2019 s right RUST . Perhaps it \u2019 s from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty . Even some parts of the lace had rust on it . This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for . I had a wedding to go to last minute so I thoroughly washed it and even disinfected it with Lysol . I also bought some wig combs to sew them in myself , instead of using the rusty one attached to the wig . Lol , Desperate times calls for desperate measures . I knew I would not be able to get my money back after cutting the lace and sewing clips in so I didn \u2019 t bother sending it back . The pics here . The hair is beautiful when styled and holds curls very well . To be honest , if this hair didn \u2019 t shed or have rust in it , I would rate it 5 stars . Unfortunately , paying $ 100 for hair I do not expect it to be rusty . I had to buy separate wig combs and sew them in myself so I don \u2019 t get the rust in my own hair and scalp .

Not only for children but adults as there is so much history to learn about . love that they show color photos of a scene during the book . So much history : how the Santa letter came about over the years , the origins of Santa . Each section of years has a summary and toy terminology and the charm of children , living history section and a don ' t miss area before it gets into the letters . Amazing to learn when tinker toys were invented among other toys that we in our 60 ' s remember . So many fond memories over the years , what a treasure this book is .",

Then you should use it empty . You will see how much yellow the water under the steamer is . If it is still quite a lot and the steamer smells , keep soaking , if it is just tinted with yellow and the smell is very faint , steam empty steamer several times and soak after each steaming . ( i do not know if the instructions are correct but this is what I found by trial and error . Finally , when you cook food , always put baking paper under it . Especially if you steam fish .

I ' ve had it only for a week , but so far am very happy with it . The pictures accurately show the color & pattern . The pattern wraps over the edge of the band & goes a little way onto the back , so it doesn ' t look like something that ' s just stamped on the outside . A week is too short to know , but the pattern seems to be resistant to scraping off or fading . I ' m not about to scrape it to find out , but may update the review later . The buckle appears identical to the brand name band that came with the Charge 2 . I buckle & unbuckle pretty often to tighten the band for exercise .
