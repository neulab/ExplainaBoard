The combination of a fluoropyrimidine ( 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine ) with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan has been widely accepted as standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for either the first- or second-line treatment of mCRC .	['fluoropyrimidine', '5-fluorouracil', 'capecitabine', 'oxaliplatin', 'irinotecan']	Options for Second-Line Treatment in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major public health problem in the United States and worldwide. The majority of patients who have CRC eventually present with metastatic disease. The overall therapeutic goals for most patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) are to control the disease, prolong life span, and maximize quality of life. Therefore, the ratio of efficacy to toxicity is one of the most important factors in choosing among treatment options and sequencing regimens. In addition, the choice of first-line systemic therapy will affect the options for second-line treatment. Several newer cytotoxic agents for the treatment of mCRC have been approved during the past 2 decades by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine. The combination of a fluoropyrimidine ( 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine ) with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan has been widely accepted as standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for either the first- or second-line treatment of mCRC . The FDA has approved several pathway-targeting agents for the treatment of mCRC; these include agents that target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor pathway (bevacizumab, ziv-aflibercept, and ramucirumab) and those that target the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway (cetuximab and panitumumab). Here, we review the current clinical options for the second-line treatment of mCRC and the rationales for their use. 	0	0	33	219	4	1.0
We now wish to report that , under these conditions , the pss-8 mutant is hypersensitive to certain antibiotics , especially to streptomycin , kanamycin , and gentamicin , although also to ampicillin and novobiocin .	['streptomycin', 'kanamycin', 'gentamicin', 'ampicillin', 'novobiocin']	Envelope composition and antibiotic hypersensitivity of Escherichia coli mutants defective in phosphatidylserine synthetase. Mutants of Escherichia coli K12, defective in phosphatidylserine synthetase (pss), can be isolated as temperature-sensitive, conditional lethals. When cultivated at intermediate temperatures (30 degrees), such mutants contain approximately 3 times more phosphatidylglycerol plus cardiolipin (and less phosphatidylethanolamine) than normal. We now wish to report that , under these conditions , the pss-8 mutant is hypersensitive to certain antibiotics , especially to streptomycin , kanamycin , and gentamicin , although also to ampicillin and novobiocin . At 30 degrees, the membrane protein and fatty acid composition of pss-8 is nearly normal, i.e. identical with an isogenic pss+ organism. Radiochemical labeling and bacteriophage growth studies show that lipopolysaccharide is also unaltered. Therefore, the antibiotic hypersensitivity of pss-8 differs from previously reported hypersensitivities, associated with lipopolysaccharide defects. These results suggest that the polar phospholipid headgroups may play an important role in maintaining the barrier function of the outer gramnegative membrane and that putative inhibitors of the phosphatidylserine synthetase might potentiate the action of numerous antibiotics currently in clinical use.	0	0	36	179	3	1.0
He was initially treated with combination chemotherapy regimen of vincristine , actinomycin-D and cyclophosphamide ( VAC therapy ) .	['vincristine', 'cyclophosphamide', 'actinomycin-D']	[Rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder: a case report]. A 15-year-old man with the chief complaint of general fatigue was referred to our hospital on November 11, 1993. Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy was performed for postrenal anuria. X-ray examinations revealed a huge intrapelvic tumor, and it was histopathologically diagnosed as rhabdomyosarcoma by transrectal needle biopsy. He was initially treated with combination chemotherapy regimen of vincristine , actinomycin-D and cyclophosphamide ( VAC therapy ) . Pelvic exenteration was performed on December 15, 1993. Histopathological findings were alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with degenerative change and partial necrosis. After the operation, he was given two course of VAC therapy. In May, 1994, brain metastasis occurred, so 4 courses of VAC therapy were administered. For a very short period, neurological symptoms improved, but he died of pneumonia on November 15, 1994.	0	0	19	132	3	1.3333333333333333

The remaining 76 patients did not receive anti-thymocyte globulin but were given cyclosporine A and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil ( group 3 ) .	['cyclosporine', 'methotrexate', 'mycophenolate']	The impact of graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplant in acute myeloid leukemia: a study from the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The impact of the intensity of graft-versus-host-disease immunoprophylaxis on transplantation outcomes in patients undergoing transplantation following reduced-intensity conditioning is unclear. This study addresses this issue in 228 adult patients above 50 years of age with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission given peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-identical siblings after fludarabine and 2 days of intravenous busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning. A total of 152 patients received anti-thymocyte globulin, either in combination with cyclosporine A in 86 patients (group 1), or with cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil or short course methotrexate in 66 patients (group 2). The remaining 76 patients did not receive anti-thymocyte globulin but were given cyclosporine A and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil ( group 3 ) . Incidences of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease were comparable in the three groups (16.5%, 29.5% and 19.5% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, P=0.15). In multivariate analysis, the absence of anti-thymocyte globulin was the only factor associated with a higher risk of chronic graft-versus-host-disease (P=0.005), while the use of triple immunosuppression (group 3) was associated with an increased risk of relapse (P=0.003). In comparison to anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A alone, the other two strategies of graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis were associated with reduced leukemia-free survival and overall survival (P=0.001 for each parameter), independently of the dose of anti-thymocyte globulin. These data suggest that fine tuning of the intensity of this prophylaxis can affect the outcome of transplantation and that anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A alone should be the preferred combination with the fludarabine-busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and sibling donors. 	0	0	24	291	2	1.0

We examined the feasibility and safety of using paclitaxel and trastuzumab as maintenance therapy after high-dose chemotherapy ( HDC ) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( AHST ) for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer .	['paclitaxel', 'trastuzumab']	Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab as Maintenance Therapy in Patients with HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Underwent High-Dose Chemotherapy and Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.  We examined the feasibility and safety of using paclitaxel and trastuzumab as maintenance therapy after high-dose chemotherapy ( HDC ) with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( AHST ) for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer . Ten patients (9 women and 1 man) were enrolled in the study. The median age was 46.5 years (range, 27-65 years). The median follow-up time was 1003 days (range, 216-2526 days). All patients had metastatic disease, but 2 had only bone metastasis. One patient had complete response, 6 had partial response and 3 had stable disease to the standard-dose chemotherapy prior to transplantation. The conditioning regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and thiotepa. After AHST, patients received weekly paclitaxel for 12 doses and trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 1 year as maintenance therapy. All patients experienced successful engraftment. The only grade 4 toxic effects observed were leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The most common grade 3 toxic effect was neutropenic fever. No treatment-related deaths were observed. The median progression-free survival time was 441 days, and the median overall survival time was 955 days. Two patients died in accidents while their disease remained in remission. Five patients died with disease progression. At the time of this report, 3 patients are alive with stable disease, 1 of whom has remained free of disease progression for 2526 days since transplantation. Our findings indicate that paclitaxel plus trastuzumab as maintenance therapy after HDC with AHST for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer not only is feasible and safe but also results in survival outcomes similar to historical results. 	1	0	37	281	2	1.0

Twenty-one Japanese colorectal cancer patients received intravenous FOLFIRI ( bolus irinotecan , folinic acid , and fluorouracil followed by 46-hour fluorouracil infusion ) followed by bevacizumab ( 5 mg/kg ) in Cycle 1 .	['irinotecan', 'folinic acid', 'fluorouracil', 'fluorouracil', 'bevacizumab']	Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in Japanese colorectal cancer patients with UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms. Previous reports of the influence of UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan metabolism have not assessed Asian patients treated with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab for advanced and recurrent colorectal cancer. Twenty-one Japanese colorectal cancer patients received intravenous FOLFIRI ( bolus irinotecan , folinic acid , and fluorouracil followed by 46-hour fluorouracil infusion ) followed by bevacizumab ( 5 mg/kg ) in Cycle 1 . In Cycle 2, patients received bevacizumab followed by FOLFIRI. The regimen was in 2-week cycles. The area under-the-curves ratio (AUC0-last) (Cycle 2/Cycle 1) was determined from plasma concentrations of irinotecan and metabolites (SN-38, SN-38G). Safety, efficacy, and drug-drug interactions were analyzed. Median observation period was 7.8 months; median number of cycles 15. Drug-drug interactions were evaluated in eight patients without irinotecan dose reduction. Mean AUC0-last ratios (with/without bevacizumab) of irinotecan, SN-38, and SN-38G were 0.959, 0.927, and 0.931 respectively. Response rate was 65%; median progression-free survival 16.4 months. Response occurred in four patients with, and nine without, UGT1A1 polymorphism. No significant differences occurred between efficacy, safety, or polymorphism status. This cohort showed no differences in safety or efficacy compared to previous reports. bevacizumab did not affect the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and its metabolites, irrespective of UGT1A1 polymorphism status. 	0	0	34	220	5	1.0
A 70-year-old Asian man was diagnosed with PVT two months after initiating 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin , irinotecan , and bevacizumab therapy for rectal cancer with liver metastases .	['5-fluorouracil/leucovorin', 'irinotecan', 'bevacizumab']	Portal Vein Thrombosis in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer During FOLFIRI-bevacizumab Chemotherapy Successfully Treated with Apixaban. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) while using an angiogenesis inhibitor is relatively rare. A 70-year-old Asian man was diagnosed with PVT two months after initiating 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin , irinotecan , and bevacizumab therapy for rectal cancer with liver metastases . Because the metastases were small and shrinking, we suspected that the thrombosis might have been caused by bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy. We stopped bevacizumab and started apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). Eight months later, the complete dissolution of the thrombus and recanalization of the portal vein were attained. Our case suggests that PVT can occur during bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy, and DOAC therapy might be beneficial for treating PVT in patients with cancer.	0	0	26	122	3	1.0
Combination treatment with cetuximab and nystatin selectively increased cetuximab uptake by tumor tissues , translating into potentiated antitumor efficacy of cetuximab in vivo ( A431 and A549 tumors ) .	['cetuximab', 'nystatin', 'cetuximab', 'cetuximab']	Enhancement of tumor uptake and therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-targeted antibody cetuximab and antibody-drug conjugates by cholesterol sequestration. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been intensively investigated as a promising cancer treatment strategy. The specific mechanism of cetuximab endocytosis and its influence on cetuximab uptake, biodistribution and efficacy still remain elusive. Recently, statins have been reported to synergize with EGFR-targeting agents. Our prior work established that nystatin, a cholesterol-sequestering antifungal drug, facilitates endocytosis via the clathrin-dependent pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether nystatin regulates the uptake and efficacy of cetuximab and cetuximab-based antibody-drug conjugates (cetuximab-ADCs). In vitro and in vivo efficacies of nystatin on the uptake and activity of cetuximab/cetuximab-ADCs were studied in multiple human carcinoma cell lines and xenograft models, respectively. We identified that cholesterol sequestration by nystatin enhanced cetuximab internalization in EGFR-positive carcinoma cells by regulating EGFR trafficking/turnover and facilitating a switch from lipid rafts to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Combination treatment with cetuximab and nystatin selectively increased cetuximab uptake by tumor tissues , translating into potentiated antitumor efficacy of cetuximab in vivo ( A431 and A549 tumors ) . Nystatin-enhanced internalization of cetuximab further improved the uptake and potency of cetuximab-doxorubicin and cetuximab-methotrexate conjugates in EGFR-positive cetuximab-resistant tumors. Combination therapy with nystatin plus either cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC further prolonged animal survival and significantly suppressed tumor growth, as compared with single-agent cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC. In summary, our results identify a novel mechanism whereby cholesterol sequestration enhances the uptake of EGFR-targeting mAb and ADCs, therefore providing preclinical proof-of-concept that combination with nystatin can potentiate the delivery and efficacy of these EGFR-targeted agents. 	0	0	30	268	4	1.0

Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5‑Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth , compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone .	['imatinib', 'irinotecan', '5‑Fu']	Imatinib‑induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. imatinib is a powerful tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets BCR‑ABL, c‑KIT, and PDGFR kinases, and is used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and other types of cancers. However, the possible anticancer effects of imatinib in gastric cancer have not yet been explored. The present study evaluated the in vitro effects of imatinib on gastric cancer cells and determined the molecular mechanism underlying these effects. We determined that imatinib induced mitochondria‑mediated apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‑associated activation of c‑Jun NH2‑terminal kinase (JNK). We also found that imatinib suppressed cell proliferation in a time‑ and dose‑dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that imatinib‑treated AGS cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, imatinib‑treated cells exhibited increased levels of phosphorylated JNK, and of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein, an ER stress‑associated apoptotic molecule. Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5‑Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth , compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone . These data indicated that imatinib exerted cytotoxic effects on gastric cancer cells by inducing apoptosis mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and ER stress‑associated JNK activation. Furthermore, we revealed that imatinib induced the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting platelet‑derived growth factor receptor signaling. Collectively, our results strongly support the use of imatinib in the treatment of treating gastric cancer.	1	0	34	254	2	1.0

We now wish to report that , under these conditions , the pss-8 mutant is hypersensitive to certain antibiotics , especially to streptomycin , kanamycin , and gentamicin , although also to ampicillin and novobiocin . At 30 degrees, the membrane protein and fatty acid composition of pss-8 is nearly normal, i.e. identical with an isogenic pss+ organism. Radiochemical labeling and bacteriophage growth studies show that lipopolysaccharide is also unaltered. Therefore, the antibiotic hypersensitivity of pss-8 differs from previously reported hypersensitivities, associated with lipopolysaccharide defects. These results suggest that the polar phospholipid headgroups may play an important role in maintaining the barrier function of the outer gramnegative membrane and that putative inhibitors of the phosphatidylserine synthetase might potentiate the action of numerous antibiotics currently in clinical use.	0	0	36	179	2	1.0

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major public health problem in the United States and worldwide. The majority of patients who have CRC eventually present with metastatic disease. The overall therapeutic goals for most patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) are to control the disease, prolong life span, and maximize quality of life. Therefore, the ratio of efficacy to toxicity is one of the most important factors in choosing among treatment options and sequencing regimens.

Bendamustine is effective both with rituximab and as a monotherapy in rituximab-refractory patients .	['Bendamustine', 'rituximab']	Bendamustine in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and refractory lymphoma. bendamustine is a water-soluble, bifunctional chemotherapeutic agent with characteristics of both an alkylator and a purine analog. bendamustine combined with rituximab in vitro shows synergistic effects against various leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Clinical trials supporting these results show that bendamustine plus rituximab is highly effective in relapsed and refractory patients with indolent lymphoma. The results have been found in rituximab-naive, rituximab-pretreated, and rituximab-refractory patients with excellent response rates and toxicity profiles. Bendamustine is effective both with rituximab and as a monotherapy in rituximab-refractory patients . Interim results from a phase III, randomized trial comparing bendamustine and rituximab to a standard CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and rituximab regimen suggest that combination bendamustine and rituximab may provide a viable alternative for treatment of many indolent lymphomas.	1	0	14	135	2	1.0

Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5‑Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth , compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone .	['imatinib', 'irinotecan', '5‑Fu']	Imatinib‑induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. imatinib is a powerful tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets BCR‑ABL, c‑KIT, and PDGFR kinases, and is used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and other types of cancers. However, the possible anticancer effects of imatinib in gastric cancer have not yet been explored. The present study evaluated the in vitro effects of imatinib on gastric cancer cells and determined the molecular mechanism underlying these effects. We determined that imatinib induced mitochondria‑mediated apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‑associated activation of c‑Jun NH2‑terminal kinase (JNK). We also found that imatinib suppressed cell proliferation in a time‑ and dose‑dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that imatinib‑treated AGS cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, imatinib‑treated cells exhibited increased levels of phosphorylated JNK, and of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein, an ER stress‑associated apoptotic molecule. Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5‑Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth , compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone . These data indicated that imatinib exerted cytotoxic effects on gastric cancer cells by inducing apoptosis mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and ER stress‑associated JNK activation. Furthermore, we revealed that imatinib induced the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting platelet‑derived growth factor receptor signaling. Collectively, our results strongly support the use of imatinib in the treatment of treating gastric cancer.	1	0	34	254	2	1.0
The remaining 76 patients did not receive anti-thymocyte globulin but were given cyclosporine A and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil ( group 3 ) .	['cyclosporine', 'methotrexate', 'mycophenolate']	The impact of graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplant in acute myeloid leukemia: a study from the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The impact of the intensity of graft-versus-host-disease immunoprophylaxis on transplantation outcomes in patients undergoing transplantation following reduced-intensity conditioning is unclear. This study addresses this issue in 228 adult patients above 50 years of age with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission given peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-identical siblings after fludarabine and 2 days of intravenous busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning. A total of 152 patients received anti-thymocyte globulin, either in combination with cyclosporine A in 86 patients (group 1), or with cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil or short course methotrexate in 66 patients (group 2). The remaining 76 patients did not receive anti-thymocyte globulin but were given cyclosporine A and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil ( group 3 ) . Incidences of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease were comparable in the three groups (16.5%, 29.5% and 19.5% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, P=0.15). In multivariate analysis, the absence of anti-thymocyte globulin was the only factor associated with a higher risk of chronic graft-versus-host-disease (P=0.005), while the use of triple immunosuppression (group 3) was associated with an increased risk of relapse (P=0.003). In comparison to anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A alone, the other two strategies of graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis were associated with reduced leukemia-free survival and overall survival (P=0.001 for each parameter), independently of the dose of anti-thymocyte globulin. These data suggest that fine tuning of the intensity of this prophylaxis can affect the outcome of transplantation and that anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A alone should be the preferred combination with the fludarabine-busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and sibling donors. 	0	0	24	291	2	1.0

Nystatin-enhanced internalization of cetuximab further improved the uptake and potency of cetuximab-doxorubicin and cetuximab-methotrexate conjugates in EGFR-positive cetuximab-resistant tumors. Combination therapy with nystatin plus either cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC further prolonged animal survival and significantly suppressed tumor growth, as compared with single-agent cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC. In summary, our results identify a novel mechanism whereby cholesterol sequestration enhances the uptake of EGFR-targeting mAb and ADCs, therefore providing preclinical proof-of-concept that combination with nystatin can potentiate the delivery and efficacy of these EGFR-targeted agents. 	0	0	30	268	2	1.0
Following corneal scrapings and culture , topical 0.5 % moxifloxacin and 0.5 % tobramycin were administered hourly .	['moxifloxacin', 'tobramycin']	A case of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia keratitis effectively treated with moxifloxacin. A 70-year-old man with a long history of diabetes mellitus presented to our hospital (Department of Ophthalmology, Sahm Yook Medical Center, Seoul, Korea) complaining of severe ocular pain and visual disturbance in his left eye that had started three days prior to admission. A round 3.7 × 5.0 mm dense central stromal infiltrate with an overlying epithelial defect was noted on slit-lamp examination. Following corneal scrapings and culture , topical 0.5 % moxifloxacin and 0.5 % tobramycin were administered hourly . A few days later, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was isolated in a bacterial culture from a corneal specimen. According to the results of susceptibility tests, topical 0.5% moxifloxacin was given every hour and 0.5% tobramycin was stopped. The patient's clinical features improved steadily with treatment. The corneal epithelium healed rapidly, and the infiltrate resolved within four weeks of the initiation of treatment. The patient's best corrected visual acuity improved from hand motion to 20 / 25.	0	1	18	165	2	1.0

['piperacillin', 'netilmicin']	Piperacillin-resistant Escherichia coli bacteraemia: relation to empiric therapy and clinical outcome. Escherichia coli is a leading cause of bacteraemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate all E. coli positive blood cultures collected during a 4-y period in a haematological department using piperacillin plus netilmicin for empiric treatment of febrile episodes . We measured the incidence of piperacillin-resistant E. coli bacteraemia among haematological and non-haematological patients, described the importance of previous antibiotic treatment for resistance development in E. coli and evaluated the impact of piperacillin resistance on the clinical outcome of E. coli bacteraemia. 114 episodes of E. coli bacteraemia in 104 patients were recorded and 98 episodes in 88 patients (42 males and 46 females) with a median age of 64 y (range 19-85 y) were evaluated. In 81.6% of the episodes the patients had a haematological disorder, dominated by acute leukaemia (41.3%), chronic leukaemia (16.3%) and lymphoma (10%). The proportion of piperacillin-resistant E. coli was higher among haematological patients than non-haematological patients (25% vs 0%, p=0.02) and resistance was associated with piperacillin therapy during the previous month (p=0.05). No difference in clinical outcome was found between haematological patients infected with piperacillin-susceptible or -resistant E. coli (intensive care 12% vs 15%; mortality 22% vs 25%).	0	0	34	207	2	1.0

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major public health problem in the United States and worldwide. The majority of patients who have CRC eventually present with metastatic disease. The overall therapeutic goals for most patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) are to control the disease, prolong life span, and maximize quality of life. Therefore, the ratio of efficacy to toxicity is one of the most important factors in choosing among treatment options and sequencing regimens. In addition, the choice of first-line systemic therapy will affect the options for second-line treatment.

Combination treatment with cetuximab and nystatin selectively increased cetuximab uptake by tumor tissues , translating into potentiated antitumor efficacy of cetuximab in vivo ( A431 and A549 tumors ) .	['cetuximab', 'nystatin', 'cetuximab', 'cetuximab']	Enhancement of tumor uptake and therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-targeted antibody cetuximab and antibody-drug conjugates by cholesterol sequestration. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been intensively investigated as a promising cancer treatment strategy. The specific mechanism of cetuximab endocytosis and its influence on cetuximab uptake, biodistribution and efficacy still remain elusive. Recently, statins have been reported to synergize with EGFR-targeting agents. Our prior work established that nystatin, a cholesterol-sequestering antifungal drug, facilitates endocytosis via the clathrin-dependent pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether nystatin regulates the uptake and efficacy of cetuximab and cetuximab-based antibody-drug conjugates (cetuximab-ADCs). In vitro and in vivo efficacies of nystatin on the uptake and activity of cetuximab/cetuximab-ADCs were studied in multiple human carcinoma cell lines and xenograft models, respectively. We identified that cholesterol sequestration by nystatin enhanced cetuximab internalization in EGFR-positive carcinoma cells by regulating EGFR trafficking/turnover and facilitating a switch from lipid rafts to clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

When cultivated at intermediate temperatures (30 degrees), such mutants contain approximately 3 times more phosphatidylglycerol plus cardiolipin (and less phosphatidylethanolamine) than normal. We now wish to report that , under these conditions , the pss-8 mutant is hypersensitive to certain antibiotics , especially to streptomycin , kanamycin , and gentamicin , although also to ampicillin and novobiocin . At 30 degrees, the membrane protein and fatty acid composition of pss-8 is nearly normal, i.e. identical with an isogenic pss+ organism. Radiochemical labeling and bacteriophage growth studies show that lipopolysaccharide is also unaltered. Therefore, the antibiotic hypersensitivity of pss-8 differs from previously reported hypersensitivities, associated with lipopolysaccharide defects. These results suggest that the polar phospholipid headgroups may play an important role in maintaining the barrier function of the outer gramnegative membrane and that putative inhibitors of the phosphatidylserine synthetase might potentiate the action of numerous antibiotics currently in clinical use.	0	0	36	179	2	1.0

A 49 years-old man presented with dry cough, low grade fever, and abnormal shadow on a chest X-ray. He had suffered from follicular lymphoma of the liver 5 years previously. He received irradiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy for approximately three years and had been in complete remission. Physical and radiological examination revealed pleural effusion and softly dense masses in the right lung. The laboratory data were within normal limits. He was diagnosed as having lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) by open lung biopsy. The lung lesion was mainly infiltrated with T cells. The patient received prednisolone and the lung lesions disappeared. However , when a lung mass was noted two months later , he started to receive combination chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide , adriamycin , vincristine , and prednisolone every three months . He has not shown relapse of LYG so far. To investigate the association between the preceding follicular lymphoma and subsequent LYG at this time, DNA analysis using the PCR technique was carried out. The LYG lesion did not show a rearranged band for the JH probe, while the paraffin-embedded specimen of the preceding follicular lymphoma had shown rearranged band for the JH band. Southern blot analysis of the LYG lesion, showed no rearrangement for TCR beta, gamma or JH probe. These findings indicate that the LYG was different from the preceding follicular lymphoma in terms of origin. LYG is considered to be induced in the immunosuppressive state due to lymphoma.	0	0	32	254	4	1.8333333333333333

In the present study, we examined the efficacy of olmesartan and azelnidipine monotherapy (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg each) and their combination therapy (1 mg/kg each) on stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) in relation to oxidative stress, inflammation, and the neurovascular unit. In comparison with the vehicle group, body weight, regional cerebral blood flow, and motor function were preserved, whereas systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure decreased in the five drug-treatment groups. Spontaneous infarct volume decreased with the low-dose combination of olmesartan plus azelnidipine and with the high-dose olmesartan, with a further decrease in the high-dose azelnidipine group. In addition, these drugs dose-dependently reduced oxidative stresses, proinflammatory molecules, and well-preserved components of the neurovascular unit. The low-dose combination of olmesartan plus azelnidipine showed a better effect than the low-dose olmesartan or azelnidipine monotherapy. The present study shows that the low-dose combination of olmesartan plus azelnidipine demonstrates a greater synergistic benefit than monotherapy with a low-dose of olmesartan or azelnidipine in SHR-SP for preventing spontaneous infarct volume, reducing oxidative stresses and proinflammatory molecules, and imparting neurovascular protection. In addition, a high-dose of olmesartan showed a greater benefit without the lowering of blood pressure, probably because of the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. A high dose of azelnidipine showed the best benefit, probably because of the two effects mentioned above related to the lowering of blood pressure.	1	0	34	274	2	1.0
The combination of a fluoropyrimidine ( 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine ) with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan has been widely accepted as standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for either the first- or second-line treatment of mCRC .

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major public health problem in the United States and worldwide. The majority of patients who have CRC eventually present with metastatic disease. The overall therapeutic goals for most patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) are to control the disease, prolong life span, and maximize quality of life. Therefore, the ratio of efficacy to toxicity is one of the most important factors in choosing among treatment options and sequencing regimens. In addition, the choice of first-line systemic therapy will affect the options for second-line treatment.

The efficacy of methotrexate ( MTX ) as a single graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis agent was compared to that of cyclosporin A ( CSA ) in 62 pediatric patients ( median age : 8 years ) with hematological malignancies who had undergone bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) from HLA-identical sibling donors at National Kyushu Cancer Center since 1977 .	['methotrexate', 'cyclosporin']	Methotrexate vs Cyclosporin A as a single agent for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical siblings: a single-center analysis in Japan.  The efficacy of methotrexate ( MTX ) as a single graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) prophylaxis agent was compared to that of cyclosporin A ( CSA ) in 62 pediatric patients ( median age : 8 years ) with hematological malignancies who had undergone bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) from HLA-identical sibling donors at National Kyushu Cancer Center since 1977 . In all, 30 patients received MTX by intravenous bolus injection, with a dose of 15 mg/m(2) on day +1, followed by 10 mg/m(2) on days +3, +6, and +11, and then once a week until day +100. A total of 32 patients were treated with CSA, which was given intravenously in the early stages and orally thereafter until day +100, and then gradually tapered and stopped 6 months after BMT. There were no differences between the groups in terms of rates of hematopoietic recovery after BMT. The probabilities of acute GVHD (grades II-IV) and chronic GVHD were 29.6 vs 40.6% (P=0.294) and 19 vs 20% (MTX vs CSA), respectively. Relapse rates and event-free survival were identical. These results suggest that MTX and CSA were equally effective when given after BMT in Japanese pediatric patients with hematological malignancies. Since MTX was given over a shorter time than CSA, it might be more practical in the management of such patients.	0	0	62	251	2	1.0

Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5‑Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth , compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone .	['imatinib', 'irinotecan', '5‑Fu']	Imatinib‑induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. imatinib is a powerful tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets BCR‑ABL, c‑KIT, and PDGFR kinases, and is used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and other types of cancers. However, the possible anticancer effects of imatinib in gastric cancer have not yet been explored. The present study evaluated the in vitro effects of imatinib on gastric cancer cells and determined the molecular mechanism underlying these effects. We determined that imatinib induced mitochondria‑mediated apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‑associated activation of c‑Jun NH2‑terminal kinase (JNK). We also found that imatinib suppressed cell proliferation in a time‑ and dose‑dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that imatinib‑treated AGS cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, imatinib‑treated cells exhibited increased levels of phosphorylated JNK, and of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein, an ER stress‑associated apoptotic molecule. Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5‑Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth , compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone . These data indicated that imatinib exerted cytotoxic effects on gastric cancer cells by inducing apoptosis mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and ER stress‑associated JNK activation. Furthermore, we revealed that imatinib induced the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting platelet‑derived growth factor receptor signaling. Collectively, our results strongly support the use of imatinib in the treatment of treating gastric cancer.	0	0	34	254	3	1.0
Haloperidol , carbamazepine and levomepromazine were then discontinued .	['Haloperidol', 'carbamazepine']	Pituitary microadenoma treated with antipsychotic drug aripiprazole. Male patient 24 years old with a pituitary microadenoma and mental and behavioural disorders due to multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances (cocaine, cannabis and alcohol) were treated with haloperidol (dopamine receptor blocker) 10 mg daily. In the last control, the patient presented mammary hypertrophy; laboratory testing and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, reporting the presence of a pituitary microadenoma syndrome with hormonal alteration (Prolactin levels 28.4 ng/ml). Haloperidol , carbamazepine and levomepromazine were then discontinued . He was started on aripiprazole 15 mg po daily for 4 days; the dosage was then increased to 30 mg po daily, with valproic Acid 500 mg po tid. After 3 weeks on aripiprazole, the mammary hypertrophy that had increased in the patient had resolved. After 10 weeks follow up of prolactin revealed a normal level, at 4.33 ng/ml. Insomnia, aggressiveness, irritability, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations remained absent after treatment with aripiprazole which is not a first line drug in multiple drug use patient with psychosis. We also consider the correlation of drug use in patient with psychosis, haloperidol treatment, pituitary microadenoma syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, and dopamine D2- receptor partial agonist aripiprazole treatment.

We report here on the state of our knowledge of the target--namely, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor--and the challenges related to the methods of determination of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and associated molecular pathways. A critical review of the anti-EGFR therapeutic strategies is also outlined. The chimeric anti- EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab has been approved for EGFR-expressing colorectal tumors in patients who progress after irinotecan-based chemotherapy in combination with irinotecan and in squamous cell head and neck carcinomas for patients with locally advanced disease in combination with radiation therapy or after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic disease ( FDA ) . cetuximab has the potential to provide an improvement of clinical outcome also in other indications and tumor types, particularly when used as first-line therapy combined with standard chemotherapy for metastatic disease or in the adjuvant setting. Possible strategies to improve the effectiveness of anti-EGFR agents are suggested and include (i) the use of predictive tools capable of making a more rational selection of patients; (ii) the development of standardized predictive biomarkers as surrogates for early monitoring of drug efficacy; and (iii) adequate study design, statistical analysis and proper end points of efficacy to be applied in future prospective trials.	0	0	59	213	2	1.0

Combination treatment with cetuximab and nystatin selectively increased cetuximab uptake by tumor tissues , translating into potentiated antitumor efficacy of cetuximab in vivo ( A431 and A549 tumors ) .	['cetuximab', 'nystatin', 'cetuximab', 'cetuximab']	Enhancement of tumor uptake and therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-targeted antibody cetuximab and antibody-drug conjugates by cholesterol sequestration. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been intensively investigated as a promising cancer treatment strategy. The specific mechanism of cetuximab endocytosis and its influence on cetuximab uptake, biodistribution and efficacy still remain elusive. Recently, statins have been reported to synergize with EGFR-targeting agents. Our prior work established that nystatin, a cholesterol-sequestering antifungal drug, facilitates endocytosis via the clathrin-dependent pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether nystatin regulates the uptake and efficacy of cetuximab and cetuximab-based antibody-drug conjugates (cetuximab-ADCs). In vitro and in vivo efficacies of nystatin on the uptake and activity of cetuximab/cetuximab-ADCs were studied in multiple human carcinoma cell lines and xenograft models, respectively. We identified that cholesterol sequestration by nystatin enhanced cetuximab internalization in EGFR-positive carcinoma cells by regulating EGFR trafficking/turnover and facilitating a switch from lipid rafts to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Combination treatment with cetuximab and nystatin selectively increased cetuximab uptake by tumor tissues , translating into potentiated antitumor efficacy of cetuximab in vivo ( A431 and A549 tumors ) . Nystatin-enhanced internalization of cetuximab further improved the uptake and potency of cetuximab-doxorubicin and cetuximab-methotrexate conjugates in EGFR-positive cetuximab-resistant tumors. Combination therapy with nystatin plus either cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC further prolonged animal survival and significantly suppressed tumor growth, as compared with single-agent cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC. In summary, our results identify a novel mechanism whereby cholesterol sequestration enhances the uptake of EGFR-targeting mAb and ADCs, therefore providing preclinical proof-of-concept that combination with nystatin can potentiate the delivery and efficacy of these EGFR-targeted agents. 	0	0	30	268	3	1.0

The overall therapeutic goals for most patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) are to control the disease, prolong life span, and maximize quality of life. Therefore, the ratio of efficacy to toxicity is one of the most important factors in choosing among treatment options and sequencing regimens. In addition, the choice of first-line systemic therapy will affect the options for second-line treatment. Several newer cytotoxic agents for the treatment of mCRC have been approved during the past 2 decades by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine. The combination of a fluoropyrimidine ( 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine ) with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan has been widely accepted as standard cytotoxic chemotherapy for either the first- or second-line treatment of mCRC . The FDA has approved several pathway-targeting agents for the treatment of mCRC; these include agents that target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor pathway (bevacizumab, ziv-aflibercept, and ramucirumab) and those that target the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway (cetuximab and panitumumab). Here, we review the current clinical options for the second-line treatment of mCRC and the rationales for their use. 	0	0	33	219	3	1.0
Combination treatment with cetuximab and nystatin selectively increased cetuximab uptake by tumor tissues , translating into potentiated antitumor efficacy of cetuximab in vivo ( A431 and A549 tumors ) .	['cetuximab', 'nystatin', 'cetuximab', 'cetuximab']	Enhancement of tumor uptake and therapeutic efficacy of EGFR-targeted antibody cetuximab and antibody-drug conjugates by cholesterol sequestration. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been intensively investigated as a promising cancer treatment strategy. The specific mechanism of cetuximab endocytosis and its influence on cetuximab uptake, biodistribution and efficacy still remain elusive. Recently, statins have been reported to synergize with EGFR-targeting agents. Our prior work established that nystatin, a cholesterol-sequestering antifungal drug, facilitates endocytosis via the clathrin-dependent pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether nystatin regulates the uptake and efficacy of cetuximab and cetuximab-based antibody-drug conjugates (cetuximab-ADCs). In vitro and in vivo efficacies of nystatin on the uptake and activity of cetuximab/cetuximab-ADCs were studied in multiple human carcinoma cell lines and xenograft models, respectively. We identified that cholesterol sequestration by nystatin enhanced cetuximab internalization in EGFR-positive carcinoma cells by regulating EGFR trafficking/turnover and facilitating a switch from lipid rafts to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Combination treatment with cetuximab and nystatin selectively increased cetuximab uptake by tumor tissues , translating into potentiated antitumor efficacy of cetuximab in vivo ( A431 and A549 tumors ) . Nystatin-enhanced internalization of cetuximab further improved the uptake and potency of cetuximab-doxorubicin and cetuximab-methotrexate conjugates in EGFR-positive cetuximab-resistant tumors. Combination therapy with nystatin plus either cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC further prolonged animal survival and significantly suppressed tumor growth, as compared with single-agent cetuximab or cetuximab-ADC. In summary, our results identify a novel mechanism whereby cholesterol sequestration enhances the uptake of EGFR-targeting mAb and ADCs, therefore providing preclinical proof-of-concept that combination with nystatin can potentiate the delivery and efficacy of these EGFR-targeted agents. 	0	0	30	268	2	1.0
The remaining 76 patients did not receive anti-thymocyte globulin but were given cyclosporine A and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil ( group 3 ) .	['cyclosporine', 'methotrexate', 'mycophenolate']	The impact of graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplant in acute myeloid leukemia: a study from the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The impact of the intensity of graft-versus-host-disease immunoprophylaxis on transplantation outcomes in patients undergoing transplantation following reduced-intensity conditioning is unclear. This study addresses this issue in 228 adult patients above 50 years of age with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission given peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-identical siblings after fludarabine and 2 days of intravenous busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning. A total of 152 patients received anti-thymocyte globulin, either in combination with cyclosporine A in 86 patients (group 1), or with cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil or short course methotrexate in 66 patients (group 2). The remaining 76 patients did not receive anti-thymocyte globulin but were given cyclosporine A and methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil ( group 3 ) . Incidences of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease were comparable in the three groups (16.5%, 29.5% and 19.5% in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, P=0.15). In multivariate analysis, the absence of anti-thymocyte globulin was the only factor associated with a higher risk of chronic graft-versus-host-disease (P=0.005), while the use of triple immunosuppression (group 3) was associated with an increased risk of relapse (P=0.003). In comparison to anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A alone, the other two strategies of graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis were associated with reduced leukemia-free survival and overall survival (P=0.001 for each parameter), independently of the dose of anti-thymocyte globulin. These data suggest that fine tuning of the intensity of this prophylaxis can affect the outcome of transplantation and that anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A alone should be the preferred combination with the fludarabine-busulfan reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and sibling donors. 	0	0	24	291	2	1.0

Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5‑Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth , compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone .	['imatinib', 'irinotecan', '5‑Fu']	Imatinib‑induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. imatinib is a powerful tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets BCR‑ABL, c‑KIT, and PDGFR kinases, and is used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and other types of cancers. However, the possible anticancer effects of imatinib in gastric cancer have not yet been explored. The present study evaluated the in vitro effects of imatinib on gastric cancer cells and determined the molecular mechanism underlying these effects. We determined that imatinib induced mitochondria‑mediated apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‑associated activation of c‑Jun NH2‑terminal kinase (JNK). We also found that imatinib suppressed cell proliferation in a time‑ and dose‑dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that imatinib‑treated AGS cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, imatinib‑treated cells exhibited increased levels of phosphorylated JNK, and of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein, an ER stress‑associated apoptotic molecule. Results of cell viability assays revealed that treatment with a combination of imatinib and chemotherapy agents irinotecan or 5‑Fu synergistically inhibited cell growth , compared with treatment with any of these drugs alone . These data indicated that imatinib exerted cytotoxic effects on gastric cancer cells by inducing apoptosis mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and ER stress‑associated JNK activation. Furthermore, we revealed that imatinib induced the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting platelet‑derived growth factor receptor signaling. Collectively, our results strongly support the use of imatinib in the treatment of treating gastric cancer.	0	0	34	254	2	1.0

Withdrawal rates were comparable to drug survival rates of other biological therapies and rates of adverse events were similar between brodalumab and ustekinumab .	['brodalumab', 'ustekinumab']	Brodalumab for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis: An Evidence Review Group Evaluation of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal. As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence single technology appraisal process, brodalumab was assessed to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of its use in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics Technology Assessment Group at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group. This article provides a summary of the Evidence Review Group's review of the company's submission, the Evidence Review Group report and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee's subsequent guidance issued in March 2018. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from three well-conducted, multicentre, double-blind randomised controlled trials. The trials demonstrated that brodalumab statistically significantly reduced the severity of psoriasis and its impact on health-related quality of life, compared with placebo, at 12 weeks. In comparison with ustekinumab, statistically significantly more patients taking brodalumab had reduced psoriasis severity at 12 weeks. Psoriasis severity and quality of life also appeared improved at 52 weeks, although statistical significance was not assessed. Withdrawal rates were comparable to drug survival rates of other biological therapies and rates of adverse events were similar between brodalumab and ustekinumab . A network meta-analysis was presented, comparing brodalumab with other therapies available at the same point in the treatment pathway (i.e. in patients for whom standard systemic therapy or phototherapy is inadequately effective, not tolerated or contraindicated). The network meta-analysis ranked treatments in order of effectiveness, in terms of achieving different levels of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index response. The results indicated that brodalumab had a similar probability of response to ixekizumab, secukinumab and infliximab and a higher probability of response than ustekinumab, adalimumab, etanercept, apremilast, dimethyl fumarate and placebo. The company's economic model compared nine treatment sequences that included three lines of active therapy, consisting of brodalumab and other comparators recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, followed by best supportive care. The sequence with brodalumab in the first-line position dominated sequences that started with adalimumab, infliximab, secukinumab and ustekinumab. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the brodalumab sequence compared to less effective and non-dominated sequences ranged from £7145 (vs. the etanercept sequence) to £13,353 (vs. the dimethyl fumarate sequence) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the more costly and effective ixekizumab sequence was £894,010 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared to the brodalumab sequence. At a threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, the brodalumab sequence had the highest probability of being cost effective (96%). The main limitation of the company's economic model was the restrictive nature of the sequences compared. Twelve separate scenarios based on key uncertainties were explored by the Evidence Review Group. The only scenarios where brodalumab was ranked lower than first were not considered to be more appropriate or plausible than the assumptions or scenarios included in the company's base case. The treatment rankings identified in the Evidence Review Group's alternative base case were identical to those derived from the company's base case model. At the first National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Appraisal Committee meeting, the Committee concluded that brodalumab appears to be as effective as other anti-interleukin-17 agents and is cost effective, based on the discount agreed in the patient access scheme. Brodalumab is recommended as an option for treating adults with severe plaque psoriasis (defined by a total Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score of 10 or more and a Dermatology Life Quality Index score of more than 10) who have not responded to other systemic non-biological therapies. Brodalumab should be stopped at 12 weeks if the psoriasis has not responded adequately.	0	0	24	626	2	1.0
